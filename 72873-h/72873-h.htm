<h3>
CHAPTER ONE
<br><br>
THE PATIENT AND HIS DOCTOR
</h3>

<p>
Christmas Eve in New York!  Broadway crowded with
happy playgoers, gay promenaders, and belated
shoppers!  Fifth Avenue resplendent with an abundance of
commercially-conceived festivity in the overstocked
windows of its fashionable shops!  In other and less
pretentious localities, gaunt lines of assassinated
turkeys exhibiting their sallow nudities in indecent
profusion to a steady stream of ever-changing faces!  In
short, everywhere throughout the big city, the people
holding high carnival&mdash;even cynicism forgetting itself
in the prospect of gallinaceous food and crude sweetmeats.
And Central Park West and the Circle, in particular,
scintillating with electrical display and wreaths
of red-ribboned holly.
</p>

<p>
In the New Theatre a gala performance of Antony
and Cleopatra was nearly over; the last lines of the
tragedy were being spoken.  Yet, notwithstanding the
fact that in another moment the folds of the red velvet
curtains would descend on the Egyptian scene, an
occupant of one of the stalls, no longer able to control
his impatience, hastily left his seat and started up the
adjoining aisle.
</p>

<p>
To say that this young man gave every physiognomical
indication of being a soul in distress would
be putting it not a bit too strongly.  Nor would it have
required exceptionally brilliant intuitive faculties to
conjecture that someone&mdash;presumably in a box across
the theatre, on which, all through the evening, his eyes
had been riveted&mdash;had shamelessly robbed him of his
heart.  Moreover, judging from his evident haste and
the keen anxiety with which all the way up the aisle
he followed every movement of the parties in the box,
it would seem that he had determined to intercept them
on their way out.  And, indeed, such was his
determination.  Life had concentrated itself into a question
of hearing from the lips of the woman,&mdash;the woman
to whom he had offered, and who had refused, the
worship of a life,&mdash;a word that he could interpret as
meaning that there was still a faint possibility of her
changing her mind.
</p>

<p>
To his vexation, however, he found that others likewise
had left their seats.  In fact, the general exodus
had already set in before, even, he had reached the top
of the aisle.  And yet, despite his being thoroughly
aware that any attempt to pass from one side of the
house to the other was sure to be resented,&mdash;so
delirious is the haste in which a metropolitan audience
takes leave of the theatre for the invariable restaurant-supper
after the play,&mdash;he continued to make strenuous
efforts to cut his way through, until realising, finally,
that it was useless, he let himself be borne along by
the crowd.  But his chance came when the carriage-vestibule
on Sixty-Fifth Street was reached.  And
there, quick to take advantage of an almost imperceptible
cessation of the onward movement&mdash;consequent
upon the people searching the ingeniously-devised
board to ascertain whether the desired motors or
carriages headed the long line&mdash;he again started in to
elbow his way through the crush; and so successfully
this time that presently comparatively few persons
separated him from an undeniably blond and dashing
young woman, in a magnificent opera-cloak of Russian
sables, who was laughing and chatting with half a
dozen or more vapid youths while following the lead
of a portly and somewhat red-faced old gentleman.
</p>

<p>
Now, though unusual&mdash;for want of a better word&mdash;as
was the young man's behaviour, few people in this
scene of orderly confusion, babel of voices and distant
humming of motors, gave more than momentary
attention to it except the young woman's escort.  To
these wondrous wise young gentlemen, however, the
meaning of his frantic exertions to reach her side was
all too plain, no less her feelings towards him; and,
exchanging significant glances, they began to nudge
one another to watch for the dénouement of the little
comedy which was rapidly developing before their eyes.
</p>

<p>
But alas for the futility of his brave resolutions...!
</p>

<p>
So far his task had been easy enough.  But at the
fateful moment, face to face with his divinity, and
doubtless for the first time perceiving that no relenting
glance softened the faultless contours of her carven
features, that no spark of warmth glinted in her big,
blue eyes,&mdash;eyes that, on the contrary, were brimful of
scornful laughter,&mdash;his indomitable spirit failed him
utterly, was crushed, for once, at least, and he stood
gaping at her, to everyone's surprise, more like a
country yokel than the man-of-the-world that he
undoubtedly was.  For the briefest of intervals he remained
thus.  And then, apparently pulling himself together,
he suddenly wheeled round on his heel, and shouldering
his way through the press,&mdash;heedless alike of a friendly
hail, which came in an unmistakably English accent
from someone back in the crowd, and of the protesting
looks, if not words, of the people he jostled,&mdash;he left
an ostentatiously, almost vulgarly, ornate limousine to
slam its door and move rapidly away with its fair
occupant and her admirers.
</p>

<p>
Into Central Park West the young man turned and
walked north.  Despite a heavy fur overcoat, his gait
was extraordinarily fast, and his face appeared white,
almost ghastly, in the thin, yellow fog that was
pushing its way under his eyelids, into the penetralia of
nose and ears, and depositing superfluous matter on
his lungs, larynx, and reckless expanse of linen.  A few
blocks above the theatre he came to a small apartment-hotel,
mounted at a run to the first floor, and quickly
entering the sitting-room of the suite, he carelessly
tossed his irreproachable high hat on to a lounge.
Then he went over to a window and stood gazing out at
the sea of fog before drawing the curtain against the
gamboge of the December evening.  And his countenance
was at once savage and inexpressibly sad.
</p>

<p>
This savageness was habitual, the resultant of bold
features: a straight nose which made a sharp angle
with the steep brow, bushy eyebrows and a wiry,
brush-backed moustache that sprouted aggressively from his
upper lip.  Strictly speaking it was not a handsome
face, though, perhaps, a striking one.  Nor in other
respects was there anything remarkable about George
Trafford&mdash;"Nervy" Trafford they had called him at
Harvard, and the appellation had always clung to him.
As to occupation he had none.  Inheriting a modest
fortune at an early age, his life had differed little from
that of the majority of young Americans in like
circumstances, if we except the fact that&mdash;before he took
up the difficult task of killing time&mdash;he had added an
Oxford degree to that of Harvard.
</p>

<p>
Throwing off his coat, Trafford fumbled in his
waistcoat for a key.  A moment later he was opening a
small mahogany medicine-cupboard that was fixed
against the wall over his book-case.  His searching
hand groped about in its recesses and then brought
out&mdash;something.  For a second he held this "something"
at arms length, conning it with curious eyes,
as a dilettante might study a precious cameo, or a bit
of rare porcelain.
</p>

<p>
Then he put it carefully on the table.  The electric
light shone on a small, compact object, dark of colour
and sinister of shape&mdash;a revolver!
</p>

<p>
Nervy Trafford took pen and paper and wrote; and
as he wrote the curious light grew in his wild eyes, and
a sad smile played about his sensitive mouth.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Dearest,</i>" he began:&mdash;"<i>You say you can never
love me.  I say that I can never cease to love you.
You have spoken a lie, even as I have spoken the truth,
for when the mists of life are dispelled by the glorious
radiance beyond the grave, you will love me as I love
you, perfectly, entirely, with the triple majesty of soul,
mind and spirit.  Till then, farewell.</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  <i>Yours, as you are mine,</i><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GEORGE TRAFFORD."<br>
</p>

<p>
Having read this curious epistle twice, he put it in
an envelope and addressed it to Miss Angela Knox,
St. Regis Hotel.  A moment later he took up the
object from the table, looking into vacancy as he
did so.
</p>

<p>
So this was to be his end!&mdash;an ending, he well knew,
that none of his friends had ever dreamed of.  A man
on whom advice was thrown away, who seldom if ever
thought twice, in other words, a creature of impulse,
yes&mdash;they would admit all that; but on the other hand
would they not recall many instances of his extricating
himself from tight places through nothing else but this
very impulsiveness and nerve of his?  Inevitably, then,
they would refuse to believe that a man like that,
however hopeless his infatuation, would take his own life.
All of which merely goes to show how ridiculous it is
for our best friends to scoff at the notion that an affair
of the heart may be taken seriously.
</p>

<p>
Trafford's face was literally bloodless; his pupils
infinitesimal black dots, gazing searchingly through
the walls of his room into the great beyond, where all
questions are answered, all doubts set at rest.  For a
moment he stood thus in vibrant silence.  Then,&mdash;as
if his mute searching had received its dumb response,&mdash;his
lips breathed a woman's name, the muzzle of the
revolver was raised head high, there was a click&mdash;and
nothing more than a click!
</p>

<p>
Trafford's arm fell limp to his side, and a look of
sick pain shuddered across his face.  Then, an idea, a
wafted air of recollection, fanned the light of
understanding into his dull eyes.  A ghost of a smile hovered
at the corner of his lips, and again the cold hand raised
the deadly mechanism to his pulsing temple.  Even as
it did so the door of his room was opened, and with
a gesture of annoyance Trafford tossed the unused
weapon on to the table and facing the intruder burst
out with:
</p>

<p>
"Who on earth&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Nervy, old chap!" was the familiar greeting
that came from a big and genial man, clean-shaved,
about thirty years of age, and dressed seasonably in a
dark, astrachan-trimmed overcoat.  In a word, the
speaker was a faultlessly attired Englishman, whose
great frame and smiling features seemed to bring into
the tragic atmosphere a most desirable air of
commonplace.
</p>

<p>
"Bob Saunders!" ejaculated Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"The same," affirmed the other, throwing off his
overcoat and sinking lazily into the most comfortable
chair he could find; "Robert Saunders, old
cricket blue, devoted husband of a peerless wife, the
friend of kings and the king of friends&mdash;<i>voila</i>!"
</p>

<p>
By this time Trafford had composed himself
sufficiently to ask:
</p>

<p>
"What in the deuce are you doing over here?  How
did you find&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Been camping on your trail, old man,&mdash;as you
Yankees say," interrupted the Englishman.  "In the
first place, the wife and I have been doing the States.
To-night, as we were leaving the New Theatre, I
caught sight of you&mdash;sung out to you&mdash;but you were
off like a shot.  I put Mrs. Saunders&mdash;divine
creature!&mdash;into a taxi and sent her to the hotel.  Then I
gave chase.  I tracked you here, and your door being
open, took the liberty to walk in.  But you don't look
well, old chap!" he went on, noticing at length the
exceptional pallor of his friend's face.  "You look
rotten!  What's up, Nervy?  Liver?  Money?"
</p>

<p>
Trafford pointed silently to the table; at the sight
of the revolver Saunders' face grew grave.
</p>

<p>
"As bad as that?" he asked.  He was genuinely
shocked, but his tone was commonplace, almost casual.
</p>

<p>
"As bad as that," breathed Trafford.
</p>

<p>
Saunders caught sight of the envelope, glanced at
the address and at once proceeded to open it.
</p>

<p>
"Stop!" cried Trafford imperiously.  "That is not
for your eyes."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes it is," returned Saunders bluntly, extracting
the letter from its envelope.  "Sit down, sick man,
and wait until I have diagnosed your case."
</p>

<p>
Trafford watched the Englishman with fascinated
eyes.  In his hour of deep darkness this smiling,
confident, almost too well-dressed embodiment of
prosperity seemed strangely comforting and reposeful.  For
the briefest of moments his present surroundings were
blotted out, and his mind rushed back through the
intervening years to the glorious days when they were
both undergraduates at Oxford.  But the illusion was
of short duration, the awakening bitter.  For as
Saunders read, a smile eloquent of contemptuous
astonishment spread over his face.
</p>

<p>
"Angela Knox!" he exclaimed.  "My dear, demented
friend, what a <i>bétisse</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"The purest, most perfect specimen of womanhood&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Angela Knox!" repeated Saunders cruelly.  "Ye
gods!  Oh, yes, I know the lady.  We met her at
Newport&mdash;a big, buxom blonde, with the intellect of
a sparrow.  Tissue, tissue, my boy, and no soul!
Features, millions also, I concede, but no sense of humour.
In six weeks she would bore you; in six months you
would bore her; in a year the machinery of the
law&mdash;your obliging American divorce courts&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Silence!" roared Trafford.  "You would poke fun
at the holiest corner of a man's heart.  I tell you, Bob,
I so love this woman that had it not been for a miracle,
I should have died five minutes ago with her name
on my lips."
</p>

<p>
"And I'm the miracle?" questioned Saunders,
tapping himself lightly on his faultless waistcoat.
</p>

<p>
"Miracle number two," replied the American, sinking
into a chair.  "That gun was kept for burglars.
To preclude the possibility of an accident through
some fool of a servant's mishandling, I kept the first
chamber empty.  Idiot that I am!&mdash;I forgot the
precaution.  But a second and doubtless more conclusive
attempt would have been made had not you butted
in&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And for Angela Knox!" cried Saunders with an
unfeeling grin.  "Now had it been a brunette&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"This is no joking matter.  For Heaven's sake, do
be serious!"
</p>

<p>
Saunders brushed a speck of mud off his patent-leather
boots.
</p>

<p>
"So I'm to take you seriously, Nervy?  Well, then,
listen, my dear, irresponsible, melodramatic friend.
Love is a wonderful thing.  It is rightly considered
the beginning and the end of all things.  I say so,
<i>moi qui vous parle</i>, though I've been married nearly
two years.  But this infatuation&mdash;this calf-love of
yours for a hypertrophied blonde with the conversational
powers of a turnip, is, <i>ipso facto</i>, ridiculous.
You will love some day, friend of my youth, but if
your love is unrequited you will not turn to the
revolver for solace."
</p>

<p>
"What are you letting me in for?" asked the
bewildered Trafford.  A powerful reaction had left him
weak&mdash;weak in voice and weak in spirit.
</p>

<p>
"I mean," went on Saunders with slow emphasis,
"that if you demand what your heart really desires
and the response is 'no,' you will, in the words of the
prehistoric doggerel, try, try again.  Love that accepts
defeat is an unhealthy passion; Love that tries to find
relief in death is a disease.  You are diseased, <i>cher ami</i>.
Buck up! and listen to the words of your good doctor."
</p>

<p>
"I'm listening," said Trafford somewhat sheepishly.
</p>

<p>
"Good!  To begin with, you are sound physically.
Muscles firm, energy splendid, and your tongue would
probably shame a hot-house geranium.  But your
psychic self is out of gear.  Wheels are racing in your
poor old brain!  Little troubles become great tragedies!
Vital things seem small and insignificant!  You
need a potent remedy."
</p>

<p>
"Let it come over speedy then!" the American
replied with some show of interest.
</p>

<p>
For a moment the Englishman looked mystified.
Presently he answered:
</p>

<p>
"You need to live in the open&mdash;plenty of sunshine
and perfect air."
</p>

<p>
"All kibosh&mdash;buncombe!" broke forth Trafford petulantly.
</p>

<p>
"No, not buncombe, but Grimland&mdash;a little country
on the borders of Austria and Russia.  Visit it,"
went on Saunders in rousing tones.  "Its highlands
furnish the finest scenery in Europe.  The air of its
mountains is sparkling champagne!  Its skies are
purest sapphire, its snows whiter than sheets of finest
lawn!  To dwell there is to be a giant refreshed with
wine, a sane man with a sane mind, and a proper
contempt for amorous contretemps.  Come, pack up your
traps to-night and catch the <i>Lusitania</i> to-morrow.
What's more, I do not advise, I command."
</p>

<p>
The American appeared half persuaded by the
other's mastery.  He sat upright, and looked more or
less alive again.
</p>

<p>
"But I should be bored to death," he objected feebly.
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it!  Why, old man, you'll forget the
very meaning of the word boredom.  You're a skater?&mdash;well,
then, why not enter for the King's Cup which
is skated for on the King's birthday&mdash;the second
Saturday of the New Year at Weidenbruck.  If you're
beaten, as is probable,&mdash;for the Grimlanders are a
nation of skaters,&mdash;there is tobogganing, curling, ski-ing
and hockey-on-the-ice to engross your mind.  All are
exhilarating, most are dangerous.  Furthermore, you
will have my society&mdash;as my wife and I will be guests
of King Karl at the Neptunberg.  However, for you,
since you have not my advantages, I recommend the
Hôtel Concordia.  You will sail with us to-morrow?"
he wound up confidently.
</p>

<p>
Trafford made a gesture of impatience.
</p>

<p>
"Honestly," he said, ignoring the question, "when
the hammer of that gun clicked against my forehead,
something also seemed to click inside my brain.  Up
to that point I had love framed up as all there was
to this world and the next.  Now I feel there is no
meaning in anything."
</p>

<p>
"Wait till you've got a pair of skates on your feet
and the breath of zero air in your nostrils!  Wait till
you've had a toss or two ski-ing, and a spill on the
'Kastel' toboggan run!  There will be meaning enough
in things then."
</p>

<p>
"It's a go, then!" declared Trafford, but without
enthusiasm.  "I'll make a getaway."
</p>

<p>
Saunders rose, a look of genuine relief on his face.
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Lusitania</i> to-morrow," he said in far heartier
tones than he had yet employed.  "Till then&mdash;&mdash;"  He
held the other's hand in a long grip.
</p>

<p>
"And you don't balk at leaving me with that?"  Trafford
pointed with a pale smile at the revolver on
the table.
</p>

<p>
"Not in the least," laughed Saunders.  "Take it
abroad with you.  Only, get out of the habit of
leaving the first chamber empty.  Such a practice might
be fatal in Grimland."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER TWO
<br><br>
THE CITY OF THE PLAIN
</h3>

<p>
"I can't see that this is such a vast improvement on
little old New York!" was Trafford's growling
comment as he strolled the streets of Weidenbruck the
evening of his arrival.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but Weidenbruck is the city of the plain!"
returned Saunders, who was accompanying him in his
perambulations.  "As soon as this skating competition
is over&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It will be back to Broadway for mine, I think!"
interrupted the American, and then went on with
despondent logic: "If it is cold here, what will it be
five thousand feet higher up?"
</p>

<p>
"Hot," retorted the other.  "At Weissheim the sun
shines unobscured by mist.  The air there is dry and
bracing.  The thermometer may stand at zero, but
your warm gloves will be a mockery, your great coat
an offence."
</p>

<p>
A gust from a side street blew a whirl of powdered
snow in the faces of the two men.  Trafford buried his
chin in the warm collar of his overcoat; he swore, but
without undue bitterness.  The cold indeed was poignant,
for the unfrozen flood of the Niederkessel lent the
atmosphere a touch of moisture that gave malice to the
shrill frost, a penetrating venom to the spiteful breeze
that swept the long length and broad breadth of the
straight, prosaic Bahnofstrasse.  The trams that rushed
noisily up and down this thoroughfare were the only
things that still moved on wheels.  Cabs, carriages,
omnibuses, perambulators even, had discarded wheels
in favour of runners; and arc-lamps shone coldly from
an interminable line of iron masts, while a cheerier glow
blazed from the windows of innumerable shops which still
displayed their attractive wares for the benefit of the
good citizens of Weidenbruck, who have raised the
science of wrapping up to the level of a fine art.
</p>

<p>
"But then why come to this cellar of a town?"
grunted Trafford.
</p>

<p>
Saunders shot a glance at his companion.  He was
genuinely fond of Trafford, had been genuinely shocked
at the narrowness of his escape from tragic ruin, and
was genuinely glad when his morbid companion began
to take intelligent interest in his surroundings,&mdash;even
though that interest manifested itself in irritable
comments and deprecatory grunts.  The Englishman had
chaffed the would-be suicide, had poured cruel scorn
on his inamorata, and preached the cold gospel of
worldliness and selfish pleasure; but if he had spoken
cynically it had been because cynicism had seemed the
right remedy, rather than because his own nature was
bitter.  Beyond having a rather high opinion of his
own abilities and a predilection for new clothes,
Saunders was a man of much merit.
</p>

<p>
"Because this skating competition happens to be
held here," he answered, "and the King's Cup is the
important event in the sporting calendar of Grimland.
The winner&mdash;who may be yourself&mdash;is looked upon as
a king among men, a demi-god to be honoured with
the burnt offerings of the rich and the bright glances
of the fair."
</p>

<p>
"The latter I can dispense with.  Cut it out!" the
American exclaimed with much bitterness, and then went
on: "I did not come to Grimland merely for sport,
as you well know, but because you hinted at political
troubles.  Moreover, I have taken your advice literally,
and have brought my gun along."
</p>

<p>
"Keep it loaded then," said Saunders curtly.  "I
hear Father Bernhardt has returned."
</p>

<p>
"Who in thunder is Father Bernhardt?"
</p>

<p>
"A renegade priest.  In the troubles of 1904 he
eloped with the Queen, who had been plotting her
husband's downfall with the Schattenbergs."
</p>

<p>
"His Majesty's opposition," put in Trafford, who
knew something of the country's turbid history.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, kinsmen of King Karl's who have always
cherished a secret claim to the throne.  They very
nearly made their claim good, too, in 1904."
</p>

<p>
"Only one Robert Saunders intervened," interjected
Trafford with an envious glance at his companion.
</p>

<p>
"Providence upheld the ruling dynasty with a firm
hand," Saunders went on to explain, "and the rebellious
family, the Schattenbergs, were pretty well wiped
out in the process.  Two alone survived:&mdash;Prince
Stephan,&mdash;who was too young to participate in the
trouble, and who subsequently died of diphtheria at
Weissheim,&mdash;and the Princess Gloria,&mdash;a girl of
one-and-twenty, who escaped over the Austrian frontier."
</p>

<p>
"And what is she doing?" inquired Trafford with
some approach to curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"No one exactly knows.  Unless she has altered in
three years, she is a beautiful young woman.  She lives
in the public imagination partly because she is a
possible alternative to King Karl, who has the demerit of
being a respectable middle-aged man.  If,&mdash;as is
rumoured,&mdash;she is in alliance with Father Bernhardt,
there will certainly be trouble, for the ex-priest is a
man of energy and resource.  Moreover, he was once
a religious man, and believed himself damned when he
ran away with King Karl's fickle consort; and a man
who is looking forward to eternal damnation is as
dangerous in his way as a Moslem fanatic seeking
Paradise."
</p>

<p>
Trafford said nothing, but breathed a silent prayer
that the renegade priest might indeed be in Grimland.
For Trafford was one of those curiously constituted
people&mdash;rarer now than they used to be&mdash;who value
excitement without counting the cost.  At Oxford he
had always regarded Saunders with a deep, if
unmalicious envy.  The Englishman had captured the
highest honours, had won his cricket blue, performing
prodigies at Lord's before enthusiastic men and women;
and, later, had played a conspicuous, almost heroic,
part in the Grimland troubles of 1904.  On the other
hand, he, Trafford&mdash;Nervy Trafford&mdash;had to be content
both at Harvard and Oxford with only limited athletic
successes, these being achieved by sheer pluck and
infectious energy.  But men had always loved him, for
he could sing a rousing song, dance a spirited
war-dance, and kindle bonfires in unexpected places with the
most expensive furniture.  In a word, his was an
ardent, effervescent nature, and now that the tragedy of
a tumultuous but misplaced passion had robbed life of
its normal interest and savour, his ideas of a diverting
holiday were of a distinctly reckless nature.
</p>

<p>
Wandering down the Bahnhofstrasse they purchased
a few picture-postcards at a stationer's, a meerschaum
pipe at an elegant tobacconist's where they sold
Hamburg cigars in Havana boxes, and finally halted
before a big corner shop where all the paraphernalia
appertaining to winter sports were displayed in
interesting and attractive profusion.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you had a good pair of skates," said
Saunders.
</p>

<p>
"So I have," returned the other.  "But there are
two styles of skating, the English and the continental;
and I am one of those rarely gifted Americans who can
skate both styles equally well,&mdash;a fact I intend to take
advantage of at this competition.  But I need a
different pair of skates for each style."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think you're really any good?" asked
Saunders, smiling.  He was accustomed to refer to
his own abilities in eulogistic terms, but was not used
to his companion doing so.
</p>

<p>
"If you were to ask that question in Onondaga,
New York, U.S.A.,&mdash;where I was born and bred,&mdash;they'd
laugh at you," was Trafford's serious reply.
</p>

<p>
"All right, let's go in and buy something from
Frau Krabb," said Saunders, leading the way into the
shop.
</p>

<p>
Within was a jumble of wooden luges, steel-framed
toboggans, and granite curling stones; from the low
ceiling hung numberless pairs of skis, like stalactites
from a cavern roof; while bunches of skates adorned
the balusters of the deep staircase leading to the upper
floor.
</p>

<p>
Frau Krabb, the proprietress, was being accosted by
another customer.  The customer in question was a
young officer in the shiny shako and a fine fur-trimmed
sur-coat of grey-blue, frogged with black.  He was a
sufficiently attractive object in his picturesque uniform,
but though his carriage was energetic and manly, the
face that showed beneath the military headgear was
by no means that of a typical soldier.  It was a dark,
oval face with a wisp of a black moustache, big lustrous
eyes, and a small, pretty mouth, adorned with the whitest
and most regular of teeth.  It was a proud, sensitive
face, more remarkable for its beauty than its
strength, but for all that, good to behold for its
intelligence, refinement, and glow of youthful health.
</p>

<p>
"Good-evening, Frau Krabb," began the soldier,
genially saluting.  "Are my skates ready yet?"
</p>

<p>
"They were ready at four o'clock, as promised, Herr
Captain," replied the woman, a plump person with
more fat than features.
</p>

<p>
The Captain passed his finger critically along the
edge of the newly-ground blades, and expressed
himself satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"And you will win the King's Cup, Herr Captain,
of course?" continued Frau Krabb, smiling a fat smile
into her customer's face.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to have a good try at it," was the
guarded reply.  "I'd sooner win the King's Cup than
the Colonelcy of the Guides.  No one has practised
his 'rocking turns' and 'counters' so assiduously as
I, and I'm feeling as fit as a fiddle&mdash;which counts for
more than a little in a skating competition."
</p>

<p>
"You look it," said the woman admiringly.
</p>

<p>
"I've got to meet Franz Schmolder of Wurzdorf,"
went on the soldier musingly, "and Captain Einstein
of the 14th, so it does not do to be too confident.
There's an American, too, competing; but I don't fear
him.  He doubtless skates only in the English fashion,
and their style of skating is too stiff and stilted to be
of any use in elaborate figures, though it is pretty
enough for big, simple movements and combined skating.
Schmolder's the man I fear, though Einstein's a
big and powerful skater, with the nerve of a demon."
</p>

<p>
"Herr Schmolder has a strained knee," said the
woman, "and Captain Einstein's nerve is not so good
as it was.  He is too fond of Rhine wine and Kirschwasser,
and though he has a big frame it is not full
of the best stuffing."
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to win better than anything in the world,"
said the young officer in tones of the deepest earnestness,
his eyes lighting up wonderfully at the golden
prospect.
</p>

<p>
"You <i>will</i> win," said Frau Krabb simply; "I have
two kronen with my man on you, and you have my
prayers."
</p>

<p>
"God answer them!" said the soldier piously.  Then
in a moment of enthusiasm he bent down and kissed the
comical upturned face of the old shopwoman.  "Pray
for me with all your soul," he said, "for I want that
cup, Mother of Heaven!  I must have that cup."  And,
slinging his skates over his shoulder the officer was
about to leave the shop, when Saunders accosted him.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Von Hügelweiler!" said the latter.
</p>

<p>
The soldier's eyes brightened with recognition.  He
had met the Englishman at Weissheim a few years
previously, and was proud of the acquaintance, for
Saunders was a name to conjure with in Grimland.
</p>

<p>
"Herr Saunders!" he cried, "I am charmed to meet
you again.  You are his Majesty's guest, I presume."
</p>

<p>
"I am at the Neptunburg, yes.  Permit me to present
my friend, Herr Trafford, of New York.  Trafford,
my friend, Ulrich Salvator von Hügelweiler, Captain
in his Majesty's third regiment of Guides."
</p>

<p>
The two shook hands.
</p>

<p>
"Delighted to make your acquaintance," said the
Grimlander.  "But what are you requiring at Frau
Krabb's?"
</p>

<p>
"Some skates for to-morrow's competition," replied
Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"Himmel!" ejaculated Hügelweiler, "so you are
the American competitor.  You had better not ask me
to choose your skates, or I should certainly select a
faulty pair."
</p>

<p>
Trafford laughed.
</p>

<p>
"You are indeed a dangerous rival," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I wish to succeed," said the soldier simply.  "Perhaps
success means more to me than to you; but I
don't think I am a bad sportsman."
</p>

<p>
"I will not tempt your probity," said Trafford.
"I will select my own wares."
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler waited till the purchase was
complete,&mdash;expressing his approval of the other's
choice,&mdash;and then the three men sallied forth into the nipping
air of the Bahnhofstrasse.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going?" asked Saunders of the
Grimlander.
</p>

<p>
"Back to barracks," replied the Captain.  "Will
you accompany me?"
</p>

<p>
Saunders consulted his watch.
</p>

<p>
"Trafford and I are dining in an hour's time," he
said, "but we will walk part of the way with you.
I wish to show my friend a bit of the town."
</p>

<p>
Turning to the left, they entered one of the numerous
lanes which proclaim the city's antiquity with
gabled front and mullioned window.  Ill-lit, ill-paved
under the trampled snow, and smelling noticeably of
garlic, bouillon, and worse, the thoroughfare&mdash;the
Schugasse&mdash;led to the spacious Soldatenplatz, wherein
was situated the fine barracks of the King's Guides.
They had been walking but a few minutes, when a tall
figure, heavily muffled in a black coat, strode rapidly
past them.  Trafford had a brief vision of piercing
eyes shifting furtively under a woollen cap, as the man
cast a lightning glance behind him.  Then as the figure
vanished abruptly into a mean doorway, Saunders and
Von Hügelweiler exchanged glances.
</p>

<p>
"So he <i>is</i> back," said the former.  "Then there is
certain to be trouble."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing is more certain," said the Captain calmly.
</p>

<p>
"Who is back?" demanded the puzzled Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"Father Bernhardt," replied his friend.
</p>

<p>
And the American heaved a sigh of thankfulness.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER THREE
<br><br>
A PROPOSITION
</h3>

<p>
When the two friends left him, Captain von Hügelweiler
fell into something of a reverie.  He had told
Frau Krabb that he desired to win the King's Cup
more than anything on earth.  That was not, strictly
speaking, the case, for there was one thing that he
desired even more than the coveted trophy of the
skating rink.  Yet that thing was so remote from reach
that it was more of a regret now than a desire.  Years
ago,&mdash;when he was a sub-lieutenant stationed at
Weissheim,&mdash;he had fallen desperately in love with the
youthful Princess Gloria von Schattenberg.  Her high spirits
and ever-ready laughter had captivated his poetic but
somewhat gloomy temperament, and he had paid her
a devotion which had been by no means unreciprocated
by the romantic young Princess.  And the courtship
was not so impossible as might appear, for Ulrich von
Hügelweiler belonged to the old aristocracy of
Grimland, and his father owned an ancient Schloss of
considerable pretensions, and a goodly slice of valley,
vineyards, and pine forests fifty miles northwest of
Weidenbruck.  But the Princess's father,&mdash;the Grand Duke
Fritz,&mdash;was an ambitious man, already seeing himself
on the throne of Grimland, and poor Hügelweiler had
been sent about his business with great celerity and
little tact.  To the young officer the blow had been a
crushing one, for his whole heart had been given, his
whole soul pledged, to the vivacious Princess,
and,&mdash;though years had rolled by,&mdash;time had done little to
soften the bitterness of his deprivation.  To his credit,
be it said, that he had never sought consolation
elsewhere; to his discredit, that he regarded his misfortune
as a personal slight on the part of a malicious and
ill-natured fate.  For his was a self-centred nature that
brooded over trouble, never suffering a bruise to fade
or a healthy scar to form over an old wound.  Even
now his excitement at the glorious prospect of winning
success and fame on the skating rink was marred and
clouded by the hideous possibility of defeat.  He
desired,&mdash;with the intense desire of an egotistical
mind,&mdash;to win the Cup, but he feared to lose almost more
than he hoped to win.
</p>

<p>
On arriving at his modest quarters in the huge
building in the Soldatenplatz, the Captain was
surprised at seeing a visitor seated and awaiting his
arrival.  A man of medium height was reclining comfortably
in his big armchair; his legs, high-booted and
spurred, were thrust out in negligent repose, an eyeglass
was firmly fixed in his right eye, a half-consumed
cigarette smouldered beneath his coldly smiling lips.
Von Hügelweiler drew himself up to the salute.  His
visitor was no less a personage than the
Commander-in-Chief of the Army of Grimland, General Meyer, the
most intimate friend of his Majesty King Karl.
</p>

<p>
"Your cigarettes are excellent, Captain," began the
General.
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler regarded the cynical Jewish face in
silence.  General Meyer was a man whom few understood
and many feared.  The greatcoat,&mdash;thrown open
at the breast,&mdash;half revealed a number of famous
Orders, none of them won by prowess on the field of
battle.  The spurred boots and the riding whip that
occasionally flicked them suggested the horseman,
though all knew that General Meyer was never so ill
at ease as when on horseback.  The dreamy eye, the
slothful pose, the drawled speech, suggested anything
but the ruler of a fiery soldiery, but for all that Meyer
had won his way and held his post by something more
formidable than a courtly tongue and a capacity for
epigrammatic badinage.  Those who served Meyer well
were served well in return; those who flouted the
Jew,&mdash;even in secret,&mdash;had a curious habit of being
superannuated at an early period in their career.
</p>

<p>
"Pray be seated, Captain," pursued the visitor
suavely.
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler drew up a chair, and sat stiffly
thereon, awaiting developments.
</p>

<p>
"You are competing for the King's prize on the
Rundsee to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, General."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I happen to be judge of the competition."
</p>

<p>
To this the Captain offered no comment.  He was
wondering what on earth was coming.
</p>

<p>
"You are exceedingly keen, of course, on winning
this very important trophy?" pursued the elder man,
with a swift glance.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, General&mdash;exceedingly keen," admitted Von
Hügelweiler.
</p>

<p>
"As a lad," went on the Commander-in-Chief
dreamily, "I once entered an examination for
horsemanship at the military school at Gleis.  My uncle
knew the officer who was examining the candidates,
and thoughtfully sent him a dozen of champagne and
a box of cigars on the eve of the examination.  The
champagne was,&mdash;if I mistake not,&mdash;Perrier Jouet of
a vintage year, and the cigars the finest that are
grown in the island of Cuba.  I was not a particularly
good horseman in those days, but I passed the
examination&mdash;with honours."
</p>

<p>
The Captain received the information in stolid silence.
The history of the remote and somewhat disgraceful
episode did not particularly interest him.  The
General deposited his finished cigarette in a porcelain
tray, and extracted a fresh one from a tin box on the
table.
</p>

<p>
"Your cigarettes are really excellent, Captain," he
mused.  "Pray keep me company."
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler acceded to the invitation.
</p>

<p>
"You draw, I presume, certain inferences from the
incident I have just mentioned?" the Commander-in-Chief
went on.
</p>

<p>
"No, General."
</p>

<p>
"None whatever?"
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler smiled.
</p>

<p>
"None," he said, "unless you suggest that I should
be wise to send you a dozen of champagne and a box
of cigars."
</p>

<p>
The General vouchsafed no answering smile to his
subordinate's facetious suggestion.  He merely shook
his head in pensive silence.
</p>

<p>
"I am a rich man," he said insinuatingly, "and my
cellars are the best stocked in Weidenbruck&mdash;not
excepting his Majesty's.  You cannot help me that way."
</p>

<p>
Again there was silence, and slowly it was borne in
on Von Hügelweiler that he was being tempted.  The
situation horrified him.  However much he desired to
win the King's Cup, he desired to win it fairly.  On
the other hand, he neither wished to offend his
Commander-in-Chief nor ruin his prospects of success in
the competition.  He began to be angry with Fate for
placing him in a dilemma, before he knew exactly what
the dilemma was.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the Commander-in-Chief sat bolt upright,
and in a voice of great earnestness demanded:
</p>

<p>
"Von Hügelweiler, do you know that there is a firebrand
in Weidenbruck?"
</p>

<p>
"Weidenbruck is a cold place, General, but it
usually contains a firebrand or two."
</p>

<p>
"I know; but I speak of no common incendiary.
Father Bernhardt is here."
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler nodded.
</p>

<p>
"At number 42, Schugasse," he supplemented.
</p>

<p>
"You know that?" demanded the General eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"He passed me a quarter of an hour since.  He
was being followed, I think."
</p>

<p>
"Good!" ejaculated General Meyer.  "I want him.
Captain, I asked you just now if you wanted to win
the King's prize.  I learn that you are the most promising
competitor for this important affair.  The winner
of the King's prize is sure of the personal interest of
his Majesty.  Grimland,&mdash;especially female
Grimland,&mdash;loves the successful athlete.  Official Grimland smiles
on him.  Skating may not be the most useful
accomplishment for a soldier, but proficiency in sport
connotes, at any rate, physical fitness and a temperate
life.  There is no reason why you should not gain this
trophy, and there is no reason why the gainer should
not go far."
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler's dark eyes flamed at the words,
and his handsome, sombre face glowed involuntarily at
the other's suggestion.
</p>

<p>
"As I am to be the judge," continued the General
calmly, "there is no reason why your victory should
not be a foregone conclusion."
</p>

<p>
Slowly the Captain's face hardened to a mask, and
his eyes became points of steel.
</p>

<p>
"I do not follow, General," he said stiffly.
</p>

<p>
"You are a shade dense, my young friend," said
Meyer, leaning forward and tapping the other's knee.
"You want the King's prize; I want the King's enemy."
</p>

<p>
"But I cannot give him to you," protested the Captain.
</p>

<p>
"You know where he is housed; you have a sword."
</p>

<p>
"You wish me to effect his arrest, General?  You
have but to command."
</p>

<p>
"I do not desire his arrest in the least," said
General Meyer, sighing wearily at the other's
non-comprehension, and reclining again in the depths of his
arm-chair.  "If I wished his arrest I should go to
Sergeant Kummer of our estimable police force.  Father
Bernhardt is a dangerous man, and a more dangerous
man arrested than at large.  He has the fatal gift of
touching the popular imagination.  The ex-Queen is a
woman of no strength, the exiled Princess Gloria is but
a figure-head, a very charming figure-head it is true,
but still only a figure-head.  Father Bernhardt is a
soldier, statesman, and priest in one inflammatory
whole.  He has a tongue of fire, a genius for organisation,
the reckless devotion of an <i>âme damnée</i>.  His
existence is a menace to my royal master and the peace
of Grimland.  He had the misfortune to cause me a
sleepless night last night.  Captain von Hügelweiler, I
must sleep sound to-night."
</p>

<p>
The Captain rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"If you give your orders, General, they shall be
obeyed," he said, in a voice that bespoke suppressed
emotion.
</p>

<p>
The General yawned slightly, and then contemplated
his companion with an ingratiating smile.
</p>

<p>
"My dear young man," he remarked blandly, "for
the moment I'm not a general, and I am giving no
orders.  I am the judge of the skating competition
which is to be held to-morrow, and in order that I
shall be able to do full justice to your merits it is
necessary that I should sleep well to-night.  Do I
make my meaning clear?"
</p>

<p>
"Diabolically so," the words slipped out almost
involuntarily.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," said the Commander-in-Chief
stiffly.
</p>

<p>
But Von Hügelweiler's temper was roused.  He had
been prepared, if necessary, to compromise with his
conscience.  He had argued,&mdash;with the easy morality
of the egotist,&mdash;that he probably desired the King's
prize more than any of his competitors, and probably
deserved it more.  Had Meyer demanded a little thing
he might have granted it.  But the thing asked was
not little to a sensitive man with certain honourable
instincts.
</p>

<p>
"I am a soldier, General," he declared, "and I am
accustomed to accepting orders, not suggestions.  If
you order me to arrest this man I will take him dead
or alive.  If you suggest that I should murder him as
a bribe to the judge of this skating competition, I
refuse."
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler's words rang high, and it was plain
that his indignation was perilously near mastering his
sense of discipline.  But General Meyer's cynical smile
never varied a hair's breadth, his pose never lost a
particle of its recumbent indolence.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Captain," he said at length.  "Then I
must take other means.  Only do me the justice of
confessing that I asked a favour when I might have
commanded a service.  Remember that all Grimlanders
are not so dainty as yourself, and remember that
murder is an ugly word and hardly applicable to the
destruction of vermin.  If this cursed priest is brought
to trial there will be trouble in the city, street-fighting
perhaps, in the narrow lanes round the cattle-market;
any way, more bloodshed and misery than would be
caused by an infantry sword through a renegade's
breast-bone."
</p>

<p>
"But is an open trial a necessity?" demanded the
Captain, his anger vanishing in the chilling certainty
that the King's prize would never be his.
</p>

<p>
But the Commander-in-Chief had had his say.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, rising to his feet, "if you will not
do what is required, someone else must.  No, don't
salute me.  I'm only an old Jew.  Permit me to honour
myself by shaking the hand of an honest man."
</p>

<p>
For a half-moment the generosity of the words
rekindled the dying hopes in the Captain's breast.
General Meyer was a strange man&mdash;was it possible that
he respected scruples he did not himself possess?  But
as Von Hügelweiler gazed into the old Jew's face, and
scanned the mocking light in the cold eyes, the cynical
smile about the mobile lips, his rising hopes were
succeeded by a deeper, deadlier chill.  With a slight shrug
of the shoulders and a smooth-spoken "Good-night,
Captain," the Commander-in-Chief left the room.
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler stood gazing at the closed door in
silence.  Then his face grew dark, and he shook his
fist after his departed visitor with a gesture of
uncontrolled rage.  His lips twitched, his features worked,
and then covering his face dramatically with his hands,
he sank into a chair.  For a bitterness, totally
disproportionate to his worst fears, had entered his childish
heart.

<h3>
CHAPTER FOUR
<br><br>
THE THIERGARTEN
</h3>

<p>
The competition for the King's Cup had no terror for
Nervy Trafford, nor did the fact that he was lamentably
short of practice affect his peace of mind.  When
a man has lost his heart's desire, has faced the barrel
of his own revolver, the prospect of gyrating on skates
before a critical audience becomes a matter of casual
importance.  When he left Harvard&mdash;to the vast
regret of his fellow-undergraduates and the infinite relief
of the much-enduring dean&mdash;he had not known in what
direction to bend his superabundant energies.  To one
who had an innate craving for an electrically-charged
atmosphere and the employment of explosives, and who
was not of the dollar-hunting kind, office work was out
of the question.  So he had gone to Oxford.  But
sport there&mdash;the sport of the English shires&mdash;was too
stereotyped and too little dangerous to appeal to his
ardent spirit.  Back again in the United States, he had
commenced a military career, but it is a platitude that
a soldier must learn to obey before he can command;
and Trafford had stumbled badly on the lowest rung of
the military ladder.  After that he had wandered.  He
had seen men and cities, and had come to the conclusion
that there was only one city, and in that city
but one person.  Whither that conclusion had led him
we have already seen.  Briefly, he was an unsettled and
rather a dangerous person in such an inflammatory
country as he was now visiting.  It is little wonder,
therefore, that the competition on the Rundsee caused
him little anxiety, either as a trial of nerves or as a
matter of vital importance in his cosmic outlook.
</p>

<p>
The Rundsee, where the contest was to take place,
was an artificial piece of water, circular of shape,
situated in the Thiergarten, the public park on the
outskirts of Weidenbruck.  At half-past two in the
afternoon its frozen surface was crowded with a vast
number of human beings, who had come to see the great
annual competition for the King's prize.  On one side
a big pavilion, garnished with small flags and red
cloth, had been erected for the benefit of the King
and the favoured few.  The majority of the throng
were crowded behind ropes, leaving a sufficient area for
the evolutions of the competitors.  There was no
question of the ice bearing so great a crowd, for the ice
of the Rundsee was as hard as a London pavement,
and many times as thick.  A battery of elephant guns
would have traversed it without inflicting a crack on
its adamantine surface.
</p>

<p>
The scene was a gay one, for the winter sun had
sucked up the morning mist and turned the dull grey
sky to turquoise, and the snowy covering of the great
trees into a bejewelled mantle of sparkling purity.  A
feeling of pent expectancy held the well-wrapped
throng, a feeling which found outlet in rousing cheers
when, with a cracking of whips and jingling of bells,
a sleigh and four horses came rapidly down a broad
avenue and halted at the back of the wooden pavilion.
</p>

<p>
It was the King&mdash;King Karl XXII., fat, smiling,
smoking, wrapped luxuriously in magnificent furs, and
accompanied by his favourites, General Meyer and
Robert Saunders.
</p>

<p>
The Grimlanders,&mdash;to do them justice,&mdash;never received
their monarch without noise.  They might hoot
or they might cheer, they might throw garlands of
flowers or nitro-glycerine bombs, but royalty is royalty,
whether its representative be hero or villain, and
it was never received in the silence of indifference.  And
at the present moment the throng was benevolent.  The
day was fine, the occasion interesting, and in the love
of sport the Grimland public forgot its antipathy to
permanent institutions.
</p>

<p>
"By the way," asked the King of General Meyer,
when they had found their way to the royal enclosure
overlooking the Rundsee, "did you secure our friend
Bernhardt last night?"
</p>

<p>
General Meyer shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"We had a failure," he replied, "another failure."
</p>

<p>
The King received the news without any outward
sign of displeasure.  Only one who knew him well
would have read the deep disappointment of his placid
silence.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you had discovered where he lodged,"
he said at length.
</p>

<p>
"I had discovered the fox's earth," said Meyer,
"but my hounds had not strong enough teeth to
inconvenience him.  I approached a certain Captain of
the Guides, a young man of good family and approved
courage.  I offered substantial rewards, but the work
was too dirty for his aristocratic fingers."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it would have been wiser to have
approached someone of humbler birth," said the King
drily.
</p>

<p>
"I was forced to that conclusion myself," sneered
the General, "and I requisitioned the services of two
of the biggest scoundrels who enjoy the privilege of
being your Majesty's subjects.  Their consciences were
un-tender, but they failed, as <i>canaille</i> will, when they
come to hand-grips with a brave man."
</p>

<p>
"In other words," said the King, "two armed ruffians
are incapable of tackling one priest.  Next time
I should try four."
</p>

<p>
"That is what I propose doing to-night, sire," said
the General impassively.
</p>

<p>
The King turned to Saunders, who was seated on
his left.
</p>

<p>
"What does the Englishman advise?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"A company of Guards and a squadron of Dragoons,"
said Saunders curtly.
</p>

<p>
"An open arrest?" demanded his Majesty.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and an open trial," affirmed Saunders.  "After
all, simplicity has its charms, and Father Bernhardt's
popularity is so great that it can hardly be enhanced
by a visit to the picturesque prison in the Cathedral
Square."
</p>

<p>
"The Strafeburg!" said Meyer, naming the prison
in question.  "I fear the good citizens might essay a
rescue."
</p>

<p>
"They certainly would," conceded Saunders, "but
the Strafeburg was not erected by a speculative builder.
It is made of stone, not papier-maché, and the
gentlemen who keep guard over it are not armed with
pea-shooters."
</p>

<p>
The General nodded sagely.
</p>

<p>
"You mean you would risk bringing things to a
head?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"That is my advice," said Saunders.  "I have only
been in Weidenbruck twenty-four hours, but have been
here long enough to see the need of strong measures."
</p>

<p>
"You are right," said the King with some bitterness;
"the woman who was once my wife and who
hates me more than anything on earth, is seen at large
unmolested in my capital.  The Princess Gloria,&mdash;a
charming young lady, who would like to see me
guillotined in order that she may sit more comfortably
in my seat,&mdash;is waiting her opportunity to cross the
frontier and take up her quarters here, if she has not
done so already.  The music-halls resound with
incendiary ditties!  There is one in particular, the
Rothlied,&mdash;a catchy melody with a most inspiriting
refrain,&mdash;which frankly and courageously advocates my
removal to a better world.  I am a patient man, God
knows, and I desire peace at almost any price; but
there are limits to my forbearance.  Yet, when I put
in a plea for action, I am told that a rash step would
precipitate a revolution.  I am beginning to think that
my friend Saunders here is my best counsellor, and that
simplicity is the best policy."
</p>

<p>
A roar of cheering from the crowd betokened the
presence of the competitors on the ice.  General Meyer
rose from his seat.
</p>

<p>
"The best policy is generally simple," he said, "and
so is the worst.  But with your Majesty's permission
I will withdraw.  My services are required below."
</p>

<p>
Hardly had Meyer left when Mrs. Saunders was
ushered into the royal enclosure.  She was a tall, fair
woman with a cold, correct profile and unemotional grey
eyes.  Her manner was usually reserved, and her speech
mocking.  She possessed, however, a keen, if caustic,
sense of humour, and those few people who were
privileged to know her well were wisely proud of the
privilege.  The King rose from his chair, his gaze
resting admirably on the tall, athletic figure in its neat
Chinchilla coat and smart fur toque.
</p>

<p>
"Enter the Ice Queen!" said his Majesty, offering
her the chair vacated by the Commander-in-Chief.
</p>

<p>
"Has the skating begun?" the lady thus addressed
inquired animatedly.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," her husband answered, "the competitors
are having a little preliminary exercise while Meyer is
putting on his skates.  But you come at an opportune
moment, my dear.  We were indulging in a political
discussion.  I was advocating bold measures; Meyer,
masterly inactivity.  I desire your support for my
arguments."
</p>

<p>
"Meyer says we can't trust the army," put in the
King.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you can't trust the army," said
Mrs. Saunders; "for it is not commanded by a soldier.
General Meyer is an excellent judge of skating and
champagne, but he is more of a policeman than a warrior.
I should send him on a diplomatic mission to a remote
country."
</p>

<p>
"And whom would you make Commander-in-Chief
in his place?" asked the King smiling.
</p>

<p>
"One of the competitors to-day."
</p>

<p>
"What!" exclaimed the King, mystified.  "Who?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, my husband's friend&mdash;George Trafford, the
American!"
</p>

<p>
The King roared with laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Why not appoint your husband to the post?" he
demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Because my husband has a young and beautiful
wife," retorted Mrs. Saunders smilingly.
</p>

<p>
"Whereas this Mr. Trafford&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Is a broken-hearted bachelor.  He is prepared to
seek the bubble reputation even at the cannon's mouth.
He has more imagination than Robert.  Besides, I
don't mind so much his being killed."
</p>

<p>
Saunders laughed loudly, while the King's sunburned
face beamed with genuine amusement.
</p>

<p>
"I have to thank Mrs. Saunders for a cheerful
moment," he said, "a rare thing these troublous times.
I'm forty-five years of age, my dear lady," he went
on, "and I've been on the throne fifteen years.
Sometimes I feel as if I had reigned as long as Rameses II.,
and sometimes I feel every bit as old and dried-up as
that mummied old gentleman in the British Museum.
At the same time, as you see, I have my cheerful
moments, and in those cheerful moments I see Father
Bernhardt in one cell of the Strafeburg and the
ex-Queen in another&mdash;the latter in a particularly damp
cell, by the way."
</p>

<p>
"And the Princess Gloria von Schattenberg?" asked
Saunders.
</p>

<p>
"Is too young and pretty for a cell," replied the
King with a smile.  "She is popular and dangerous,
but I have a soft corner in my heart for her.  I must
fight her, of course, if she persists, but I've certain
sunny memories of a little girl at Weissheim, all fun
and laughter and enthusiasm for winter games, and I
find it hard to take her seriously or wish her harm.
But for the others," he went on, hardening his voice,
"I'd have no mercy.  They are playing with fire, and
they are old enough to know that fire burns.  Arrest
them openly, I say, try them openly, I say, and if the
proletariat objects&mdash;shoot them openly."
</p>

<p>
"Hear, hear," said Mrs. Saunders impassively, putting
up her glasses and studying the faces of the
different competitors on the Rundsee.
</p>

<p>
"Meyer wants one more chance of nobbling Father
Bernhardt," said Saunders in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"He shall have it," said the King; "and I hope
and pray he will succeed.  That priest's the heart and
soul of the whole trouble.  Once he is safe under lock
and key, where can the Princess Gloria find another
with such cunning, such resource, such heedless daring,
to fight her battles and build her up a throne?  Hullo,
more cheering!  What's that for?  Ah, one of the
competitors doing a bit of fancy skating to keep
himself warm.  A fine skater, too, by St. Liedwi,* a
powerful skater, but a shade reckless, eh?"
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
* The patron saint of skating.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"That is our friend, George Trafford," said Saunders;
"a fine skater, a powerful skater, but, as you
say, distinctly reckless."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER FIVE
<br><br>
THE KING'S CUP
</h3>

<p>
As the cheers which greeted the American's essay on
the Rundsee died down, General Meyer, shod with a
pair of high-laced boots fitted with fine steel blades,
sallied forth to the ice, and shook each of the competitors
in turn by the hand.  Von Hügelweiler fancied he read
malice in the Commander-in-Chief's eye, but his spirits
had sunk too low to be further depressed by such omens
of his imagination.  He had determined to go through
with the contest, trusting dimly that his merits might
so far exceed those of his rivals that it would be morally
impossible to withhold the prize from him.  But he was
anything but sanguine, for though he believed himself
the best skater present, he felt sure that both his
countrymen would run him close, and that Meyer would
award the prize to anyone but himself, if he could
reasonably do so.
</p>

<p>
The competition,&mdash;like most skating competitions,&mdash;was
divided into two parts.  In the first, the performers
had to skate in turn a number of set figures;
in the second they had to skate for a period of five
minutes any figures of their own choosing.  In one
important respect the competition differed from others
held on the Continent&mdash;it was not held under the
auspices of the International Skating Union.
</p>

<p>
It is generally accepted that there are two styles of
skating, the English style and the Continental, or, as
it is sometimes termed, the International style.  The
characteristics of the English school are an upright
carriage, a straight knee, and a general restraint and
rigidity of pose, discountenancing any unnecessary
movement of the arms or the unemployed leg.  The
Continental style is skated with a slightly bent knee,
with the unemployed leg trailing behind the body, and
considerable gesticulation of the arms.  The exponents
of the latter claim a greater gracefulness of
execution, a freer and more beneficial exercise of the
muscles, and a wider scope of possible evolutions.  The
English stylists claim dignity, severity, and the
capacity of doing difficult things without apparent effort.
Both have their merits and their advocates,&mdash;but it is
generally accepted that to skate at all one must
employ one of these two distinct methods,&mdash;and
practically all skating competitions are held under the
auspices of one or the other school.  In Grimland,
however, under General Meyer's influence, a third school
had arisen.  In this an effort had been made to
combine the speed and steadiness of the English skaters
with the wonderful scope for brilliant and daring
evolutions afforded by the Continental method.  In
Grimland competitions, therefore, marks were awarded for
the scale on which figures were described, and the pace
at which they were performed; while, at the same time,
reward was offered for those exhilarating <i>tours de
force</i> which are impossible of execution under English
methods.  To put it differently, no marks were awarded
for style <i>qua</i> style, but for such things as accuracy,
speed, boldness, and elegance, quite apart from the
mechanical methods by which such excellences were
attained.
</p>

<p>
The first competitor to attempt the set figures was
Herr Franz Schmolder,&mdash;a lithe little athlete, who
skated with great power and elegance.  On one or two
occasions, however, he failed to hold his edge firmly
after a difficult turn, and it was obvious to Von
Hügelweiler that the strained knee which Frau Krabb had
made mention of was bothering him more than a little.
</p>

<p>
Captain Einstein was the second of the four
aspirants, and if,&mdash;as Frau Krabb had insinuated,&mdash;his
big frame was filled with an undue proportion of
alcoholic nourishment, it did not seem to have impaired
his "back brackets" or spoiled his "rocking turns."
</p>

<p>
"There's a dash about that fellow that's fine!"
remarked Trafford to Von Hügelweiler, who was
standing near him, wrapped during inaction in a big
military ulster.
</p>

<p>
The Captain of the Guides had already in his own
mind ruled Schmolder out of the competition,
exaggerating his faults to himself with egotistical
over-keenness.  Einstein, however, was skating so brilliantly
that Von Hügelweiler was beginning to experience the
deepest anxiety lest he should prove the ultimate
winner of the coveted trophy.  The anxiety indeed was so
deep that he refused to admit it even to himself.
</p>

<p>
"Wait till we come to the second part of the
competition&mdash;the free-skating," he retorted.  "Free-skating
requires great nerve, great endurance, and absolute
fitness.  It is there that Einstein will fail."
</p>

<p>
When Einstein had finished his compulsory figures
amid a round of applause, Von Hügelweiler slipped off
his long ulster.  For a moment a bad attack of stage-fright
assailed him,&mdash;for there is nothing quite so nerve-racking
as a skating competition before a critical judge
and an equally critical audience,&mdash;and his heart was
turned to water and his knees trembled with a veritable
ague; but a cheer of encouragement restored him to
himself, and he struck out for glory.  With head erect,
expanded chest, arms gracefully disposed, and knee
slightly bent, he was about as pretty an exponent of
Continental skating as one could wish to see.  He
travelled rapidly and easily on a firm edge, his turns
were crispness itself, the elegance of his methods was
patent to the least initiated.
</p>

<p>
General Meyer following slowly with note-book in
hand, smiled appreciatively, as he jotted down the
marks gained from time to time by his brilliant
"counters," "brackets," and "rocking turns."  The crowd
roared their applause, and in the music of their cheers,
Von Hügelweiler's depression vanished, and his heart
sang an answering pæan of jubilee.  Like most nervous,
self-centred men, he most excelled before an audience
when once the initial fear had worn off.  And now he
was skating as he had never skated before, with a dash,
energy, and precision that drew redoubled cheers from
the spectators and audible applause from the royal
box.  Even Meyer, he reflected, with all his malice,
could hardly dare to give another the prize now; to
do so would be not merely to violate justice, but to
insult the intelligence of every man and woman on
the ice.
</p>

<p>
At the conclusion of his effort, Trafford congratulated
the Captain warmly on his performance.  Von
Hügelweiler's dark eyes shone bright with pleasure.
Already he saw himself crowned with the invisible
laurels of undying fame, receiving the massive silver
trophy from the royal hands.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, my American friend," he said, heartily,
"go on and prosper."
</p>

<p>
With a few bold strokes Trafford started on his
attempt to do superbly what others had done faultlessly.
His style instantly arrested attention.  Here
was no lithe figure full of lissom vitality and vibrant
suppleness; no graceful athlete whose arms and legs
seemed ever ready to adopt fresh and more elegant
poses.  But here was an exponent of the ultra-English
school, a rigid, braced figure travelling over the ice
like an automaton on skates, an upright, inflexible
form, sailing along on a perfect edge at an amazing
speed, with a look of easy contempt on his face alike
for the difficulties of his art and the opinion of his
watchers.
</p>

<p>
Ever and again there was an almost imperceptible
flick of the ankle, a slight shifting of the angle of the
shoulders, and some difficult turn had been performed,
and he was travelling away in a slightly different
direction at a slightly increased rate of speed.  The
crowd watched intently, but with little applause.  They
felt that it was wonderful, but they did not particularly
admire.
</p>

<p>
To Von Hügelweiler,&mdash;trained as he was in the
theory and practice of the "Continental" school,&mdash;the
performance seemed stiff and ugly.
</p>

<p>
"Mein Gott," cried Einstein, "at what a speed he
travels!"
</p>

<p>
"He wants a bigger rink than the Rundsee!"
exclaimed Schmolder.  "A man like that should have the
Arctic Ocean swept for him."
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler was less complimentary.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think we need fear the American, my
friends," he said.  "He skates his figures fast and big,
but with the grace of a dummy.  Such stiffness is an
insult to the Rundsee, which is the home of elegant
skating.  See with what a frowning face General
Meyer follows this American about!"
</p>

<p>
"If you can learn anything from Meyer's face,"
said Captain Einstein drily, "you should give up the
army and go in for diplomacy."
</p>

<p>
"Wait till he comes to the free-skating!" went on
Von Hügelweiler.  "That needs a man with joints and
ligaments&mdash;not a poker.  Our friend will find himself
placed last, I fear; and I am sorry, for he has come a
long way for his skating, and he seems an excellent
fellow.  I will say a few words of encouragement to
him."
</p>

<p>
But Trafford had just then momentarily retired
from the rink.  He was changing his skates for the
pair he had bought at Frau Krabb's the previous
evening.
</p>

<p>
At the free-skating, which followed, Franz Schmolder
broke down altogether.  His knee failed him when
he had performed for three minutes instead of the
necessary five.  Einstein, who followed, did well up to
a point.  But five minutes' free-skating is a fairly
severe test of condition, and the big, burly soldier did
not finish with quite the dash and energy he had begun
with.  Von Hügelweiler, however, gave another splendid
display of effective elegance, and again drew
resounding cheers for his vigorous and attractive
performance.  He himself made no doubt now that he was
virtually the winner of the King's Cup.  He had
worked hard for his success, and was already beginning
to feel the glow that comes from honourable
effort generously rewarded.  Meyer would doubtless be
sorry to have to place him first, but in the face of
Einstein's and Schmolder's comparative failure, and the
American's stiffness, no other course would be open to
him.  Von Hügelweiler, however, watched Trafford's
free-skating with interest, dreading, with an honest
and generous dread, lest his amiable rival should
disgrace himself.  To his astonishment, Trafford was no
longer a petrified piece of anatomy skating with frozen
arms and arthritic legs.  He beheld instead an
exponent of the Continental school, who seemed to have
in his repertoire a whole armoury of fanciful figures
and astounding <i>tours de force</i>.  Trafford was as free
and unrestrained now as he had been severe and dignified
before.  Graceful, lissom, filled with an inexhaustible,
superabundant energy, he performed prodigies
of whirling intricacy, dainty pirouettings, sudden bold
leaps, swift changes of edge, all with such masterful
daring and complete success that the whole ring of
spectators cheered itself hoarse with enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo! bravo!" cried Von Hügelweiler, clapping
him heartily on the back at the conclusion of his
effort.  "It is good to see skating like that!  If you had
skated the preliminary figures with the same zeal you
have displayed just now, we Grimlanders would have
to deplore the departure of a national trophy from our
native land."
</p>

<p>
Trafford accepted the left-handed compliment in
silence, lighting a cigarette while General Meyer totted
up the amount of marks he had awarded to the several
competitors.  After a few minutes' calculation,&mdash;and
after his figures had been checked by a secretary,&mdash;the
General skated back to the front of the royal box
and announced his decision to the King.  Then, at a
word from his Majesty, a gentleman in a blue and
yellow uniform placed a gigantic megaphone to his lips,
and turning it to the various sections of the crowd,
announced:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The King's Prize: the winner is Herr George
Trafford; second, Captain Ulrich Salvator von
Hügelweiler."
</p>

<p>
The American received the announcement with complete
outward calmness.  And yet those hoarsely spoken
words had touched a chord in his heart that he had
believed snapped and irrevocably broken.  For a
moment he lived, for a moment the cheers of his fellow
men had galvanised into healthy activity the dead brain
that had lost interest in all things under the sun.  The
success itself was a trivial affair, yet in a magic
moment he had become reconciled to life and its burden,
vaguely thankful that he had kept the first barrel of
his revolver free from powder and ball.
</p>

<p>
"Congratulations, Herr Trafford," said General
Meyer, who now approached him with proffered hand.
"Escort me, I beg, to his Majesty, who will present
you with the cup.  You will also receive a royal
command to dine to-morrow night at the Palace."
</p>

<p>
"Congratulations, Herr Trafford," said another
voice.
</p>

<p>
Trafford looked round and beheld the competitor
who had been placed second.  The tone of the felicitation
was one of undisguised bitterness, the face of the
speaker was the ashen face of a cruelly disappointed
man.  And Von Hügelweiler, honestly believing himself
cheated of his due,&mdash;and not bearing to see
another receive the prize which he felt should have been
his,&mdash;slunk from the scene with hate and misery and all
uncharitableness in his tortured soul.  Then, as he took
off his skates, the cheering broke out again, and told
that the American was receiving the trophy from the
King's hand.  An ejaculation of bitterness and wrath
burst from his lips.
</p>

<p>
Hardly had he breathed his angry word into the
frosty air when a small hand plucked at his fur-lined
coat, and looking round he perceived a charming little
face gazing into his own.
</p>

<p>
"Why so cross, Captain?'" asked the interrupter
of his execration.
</p>

<p>
Captain von Hügelweiler's hand went up to the salute.
</p>

<p>
"Your Royal High&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush! you tactless man," said the Princess Gloria,
for it was no other.  "Do you want to have me
arrested?  For the sake of old times," she went on,
putting her arm in his, "I claim your protection."
</p>

<p>
But Hügelweiler had not thought of delivering the
exiled Princess to the authorities!  For one thing, his
mind was too occupied with self-pity to have room for
State interests; secondly, he was still in love with the
fascinating creature who looked up at him so appealingly,
that he would sooner have killed himself than
betrayed the appeal of those wondrous eyes.
</p>

<p>
They were strolling away from the Rundsee in the
direction of the town, and a straggling multitude of
the spectators was streaming behind them in the snowy
Thiergarten.
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler's lips trembled a little.
</p>

<p>
"It is good to see you again, Princess," he whispered.
"It is comforting, just when I need comfort."
</p>

<p>
"Comfort!" echoed his companion with a grimace.
"You were swearing, Ulrich!  You are a good sportsman,
you should take defeat with better grace."
</p>

<p>
"I can accept open defeat, Princess, like a man,
though I had set my heart on the prize.  But I was
not fairly beaten.  The American skated his figures
as ungracefully as they could be skated."
</p>

<p>
"Why, he skated marvellously," declared the Princess
enthusiastically.  "I never saw such speed and daring
on the ice.  The man must have been born with
skates on.  I never saw a finer&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" broke in the irate Captain, forgetting
both manners and affection in the extremity of his
wrath.  "He won because General Meyer had a grudge
against me.  He asked me last night to do a dirty piece
of work.  In the name of loyalty he wished me to
murder a civilian; but I am a Von Hügelweiler, not an
assassin, and I refused, though I knew that by so doing
I was ruining my chances of success to-day."
</p>

<p>
The Princess Gloria pressed his arm sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"The King's service frequently involves dirty work,"
she said, looking at him out of the corner of her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"So it appears!"
</p>

<p>
"Why not embrace a service that calls for deeds of
valour, and leads to high honour?"
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler looked at the bright young face
that now was gazing into his so hopefully.  A thousand
memories of a youthful ardour, born amidst the suns
and snows of Weissheim, rushed into his kindling
heart.  He had lost the King's Cup; might he not wipe
out the bitter memory of defeat by winning something
of incomparably greater value?  There was a price, of
course; there always was, it seemed.  Last night it was
the honour of a clean man; to-day it was loyalty to his
King.  But how much greater the present bribe than
that offered by the Commander-in-Chief!  The intoxication
of desire tempted him, tempted him all the more
shrewdly because of his recent depression.  What had
he to do with a career that was tainted with such a head
as the scheming Jew, Meyer?  What loyalty did he
owe to a man served by such officers and such method
as was Karl?  The Princess's eyes repeated their
question, and their silent pleading shook him as no words
could have done.
</p>

<p>
"What service?" he asked falteringly.
</p>

<p>
"My service," was the hushed retort.
</p>

<p>
"And the reward?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Honour."
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;love?"
</p>

<p>
There was silence momentary, but long enough for
the forging of a lie.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," she breathed, looking down coquettishly.
</p>

<p>
A great light shone in the Captain's eyes, and the
sombre beauty of his face was illumined by a mighty
joy.
</p>

<p>
"Princess Gloria," he cried, "I am yours to the
death!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER SIXTH
<br><br>
"WEIN, WEIB, UND GESANG"
</h3>

<p>
That evening Mr. and Mrs. Robert Saunders were
George Trafford's guests in a private room of the
Hôtel Concordia.  In the centre of the dining table
stood a big silver trophy of considerable value and
questionable design.  As soon as the soup had been
served, Trafford solemnly poured out the contents of
a champagne bottle into its capacious depths.  He then
handed it to Mrs. Saunders.
</p>

<p>
"Felicitations," she said, taking the trophy in both
hands, "I drink to St. Liedwi, the patron saint of
skaters, coupled with the name of George Trafford,
winner of the King's Cup."
</p>

<p>
Saunders was the next to take the prize in his hands.
</p>

<p>
"I drink a health unto their Majesties, King
Edward of England and King Karl of Grimland, and to
the President of the United States," he said; and then
bowing to his host, "Also to another good sportsman,
one Nervy Trafford.  God bless 'em all!"
</p>

<p>
Trafford received the cup from Saunders, his lips
muttered something inaudible, and tossing back his
head he drank deep.
</p>

<p>
"What was your toast, Mr. Trafford?" demanded
Mrs. Saunders quietly.
</p>

<p>
The winner of the cup shook his head sagely.
</p>

<p>
"That is a secret," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"A secret!  But I insist upon knowing," returned
the lady.  "Tell me, what was your toast?"
</p>

<p>
Trafford hesitated a moment.
</p>

<p>
"I toasted '<i>Wein, Weib, und Gesang,</i>'" he
announced at length.
</p>

<p>
"Wine, woman, and song!" repeated Mrs. Saunders.
"A mere abstract toast, which you would have
confessed to at once.  Please particularise?"
</p>

<p>
"The 'wine,'" said Trafford, "is the wine of champagne,
which we drink to-night, '89 Cliquot.  'Woman,'
is Eve in all her aspects and in all countries&mdash;Venus
victrix, sea-born Aphrodite, Astarte of the Assyrians,
Kali of the Hindoos.  God bless her!  God bless all
whom she loves and all who love her!"
</p>

<p>
"And the song?" demanded Saunders.
</p>

<p>
"The song is the one I have heard one hundred and
fifty times since I have been here," replied Trafford.
"Its title is unknown to me, but the waiters hum it in
the passages, the cabmen chant it from their box seats,
the street-boys whistle it with variations in the
Bahnhofstrasse."
</p>

<p>
"That sounds like the Rothlied," said Saunders.
"It is a revolutionary air."
</p>

<p>
"I like it enormously," said Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you would," said Saunders.  "You have
the true Grimlander's love of anarchy.  But if you
wish, we will subsequently adjourn to the Eden Theatre
of Varieties in the Karlstrasse.  I am told that the
Rothlied is being sung there by a beautiful damsel of
the aristocratic name of Schmitt."
</p>

<p>
"I have seen her posters," said Trafford, "and I
should like, I confess, to see the original.  But what
of Mrs. Saunders?  Is the 'Eden' a respectable place
of entertainment?"
</p>

<p>
"It is an Eden of more Adams than Eves," said
Mrs. Saunders.  "No, I do not propose to follow you
into its smoky, beer-laden atmosphere.  I am going to
accompany Frau generalin von Bilderbaum to the
opera to hear 'La Bohême.'  But before I leave I want
further enlightenment on the subject of your toast.
'Wein' is all right, and 'Gesang' is all right, but
what about 'Weib'?  I thought you had sworn off
the sex."
</p>

<p>
"Sworn off the sex!&mdash;Never!  True, I offered to one
individual my heart, and hand, and soul; but the
individual deemed the offering unsatisfactory.  I now offer
to the whole female race what I once offered to one
member of it."
</p>

<p>
"Polygamist!" laughed Saunders.
</p>

<p>
"No," explained Trafford, "it's a case of first
come, first served."
</p>

<p>
"You are offering your heart and hand and soul
to the first eligible maiden who crosses your path?"
asked Mrs. Saunders, with upraised brows.
</p>

<p>
"My heart and hand," corrected Trafford with
great dignity.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come," Saunders broke forth, "it's time we
were off!"
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The auditorium of the Eden Theatre was a long
oblong chamber, with a crude scheme of decoration,
and no scheme of ventilation worth speaking about.
It possessed, however, a good orchestra, an excellent
brew of lager beer, and usually presented a tolerably
attractive show to the public of Weidenbruck.  For the
sum of four kronen per head Saunders and Trafford
obtained the best seats in the building.  For the
expenditure of a further trivial sum they obtained long
tumblers of the world-famed <i>tigerbräu</i>.
</p>

<p>
"A promising show this," said Trafford, lighting a
large cigar.  An exceedingly plump lady in magenta
tights, was warbling a patriotic ditty to the tune of
"Won't you come home, Bill Bailey?"
</p>

<p>
"More quantity than quality," commented Saunders
cynically.  "Personally,&mdash;not being possessed of
your all-embracing enthusiasm for womanhood at large,&mdash;I
find myself looking forward to the next item on
the programme."
</p>

<p>
"What's that?  The 'Rothlied'?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Midgets."
</p>

<p>
Trafford uttered an exclamation of disgust.
</p>

<p>
"Little things amuse little minds," he said rudely.
"Give me a strong man or a giant, and I will watch
with interest."
</p>

<p>
At this point the curtain descended on the plump
warbler, and a powdered attendant in plush knickerbockers
removed the number 7 from the wings, and
substituted the number 9.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it isn't the midgets yet, after all," said
Saunders, consulting his programme.  "It's the <i>Schöne
Fräulein Schmitt</i>&mdash;the beautiful Miss Smith.  I
wonder if she's as lovely as her posters."
</p>

<p>
As the curtain drew up again, a young girl tripped
lightly on to the middle of the stage, and it was at
once manifest that the epithet "<i>schone</i>" was no mere
advertising euphemism.
</p>

<p>
Her black skirt was short, her black bodice low, and
her black picture hat exceedingly large, but her limbs
were shapely, her eyes marvellously bright though
small, and there was a vivacity and grace in her
movements that put her predecessor to shame.  When she
sang, her voice proved to be a singularly pure soprano,
and,&mdash;what was more remarkable,&mdash;gave evidence of
considerable taste and sound training.  The song was
a dainty one, all about a young lady called Nanette,
who conquered all hearts till she met someone who
conquered hers.  And then, of course, Nanette lost her
art, as well as her heart, and could make no impression
on the only man who had really touched the deeps of
her poor little soul.  The last verse, naturally, was
a tragedy,&mdash;the usual tragedy of the smiling face and
the aching bosom.  The idea was not exactly a novel
one, but the air was pretty, and the singer's
personality won a big success from the commonplace theme.
Anyway, the audience rose to her, and there was much
clapping of hands, clinking of beer glasses, and
guttural exclamations of enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!" cried Trafford ecstatically, "Bravo!
Bravissimo!  Behold an artist among artistes, a fairy
of the footlights!  Bravo!  Well done, beautiful Miss
Schmitt!"
</p>

<p>
"Charming," agreed Saunders more calmly, "and,
strangely enough, extraordinarily like a young lady I
met a few years ago."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it is the young lady," suggested Trafford.
"I noticed she fixed her beady black eyes on you
during the last verse."
</p>

<p>
"I think not," said Saunders drily.  "The young
lady I was referring to was a somewhat more exalted
personage than Fräulein Schmitt."
</p>

<p>
The fascinating songstress re-appeared for her encore,
and this time the orchestra struck up a martial
air with a good deal of rolling drums in it.
</p>

<p>
"My 'Gesang,'" whispered Trafford excitedly.
</p>

<p>
"The 'Rothlied,'" said Saunders.
</p>

<p>
Again the Fräulein sang, and now the burthen of
her song was of battlefields and war's alarms.  The
tune was vastly inspiriting, and the audience knew it
well, taking up the chorus with infectious enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"It's great!" muttered Trafford, twirling excitedly
at his moustaches.  "By the living Jingo, it's great!"
</p>

<p>
And of a truth the air was an intoxicating one.
There was gunpowder in it, musketry and cold steel,
reckless charges and stern movements of advance.  One
caught the thunder of hoofs and the blare of bugles.
Its infection became imperious, maddening even,&mdash;for
the audience forgot their pipes and their <i>tigerbräu</i>,
and beat time to the insistent rhythm, till the chorus
gave them a chance of imparting their enthusiasm to
the roaring refrain.  The girl herself seemed the
embodiment of martial ardour.  She trod the stage like
a little war-horse, her eye sought the gallery and
struck fire from the beer-loving <i>bourgeoisie</i>.  For a
second her gaze seemed to fall upon Saunders mockingly,
and with an air of challenge.  Then she glanced round
the crowded house, held it spellbound, lifted it up,
carried it to high regions of carnage, self-sacrifice, and
glory.  The audience roared, clapped, screamed with
exuberant acclaim.  Their state was <i>frénétique</i>&mdash;no
other word, French, English, or German, well
describes it.
</p>

<p>
"By George, she's a witch!" said Trafford.  "She's
as dangerous as a time fuse.  I'll be hanged if I don't
want to fight someone!"
</p>

<p>
The encore verse was more pointed, more sinister,
less general in its application.  It spoke of wrongs to
be righted, tyranny to be overcome, freedom to be
gained.  It hinted of an uplifting of the proletariat,
of armed citizens and frenzied women, of tumult in
square and street; it breathed of barricades and civic
strife, the vast upheaval of a discontented people
determined to assert their rights.  Men looked at each
other and stirred uneasily in their seats, and then
glanced round in apprehension,&mdash;as if expecting the
entrance of the police.  The song was a veritable
"Marseillaise," a trumpet call to revolution, a match in a
barrel of gunpowder; and with the final chorus and the
stirring swing of the refrain, all remnants of prudence
and restraint were cast to the winds.  The house rose
<i>en masse</i>; men mounted their seats and waved sticks
and umbrellas aloft; a party of young officers drew
their swords and brandished them with wild insurgent
cries.  Forbidden names were spoken, cheers were raised
for popular outlaws and suspects, groans for unpopular
bureaucrats and the King's favourites.  It was an
intoxicating moment,&mdash;whatever one's sympathies
might be,&mdash;and it was obvious enough that the temper
of the people was frankly revolutionary, and that the
authorities would be quite justified,&mdash;from their point
of view,&mdash;in arresting the audience and the
management <i>en bloc</i>.
</p>

<p>
"We'd better clear out," suggested Saunders;
"there's going to be trouble."
</p>

<p>
"If there's a row," announced Trafford grimly, "I'm
going to be in it.  You've seen stirring times over here
before, but I'm a novice at it, and I want blooding.
Shall we raise three cheers for Karl and fight our way
out?"
</p>

<p>
"Not if you want to keep your thick skull weather-proof,"
was the sensible retort.  "There's always
discontent in Grimland, but there's a big sea running just
now, and it isn't wise to fight the elements.  Sit tight,
my friend, and you'll live to see more exciting things
than a noisy night at the Eden Music-Hall."
</p>

<p>
The curtain was down again now, but the audience
still roared for the re-appearance of their favourite,
still clamoured for another verse of the intoxicating
song.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo! what's this?" cried Trafford.  An attendant
had edged her way up to Saunders, and was offering
him a folded note on a tray.  "<i>If you have any
pleasant memories of the winter of 1904, come round to
the stage door and ask for Fräulein Schmitt.</i>"  That
was the purport of the note, and after reading it,
Saunders handed it to Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"Then it must be your lady friend, after all,"
maintained the latter, smiling at his friend.
</p>

<p>
"It must indeed," acquiesced Saunders with a frown.
"Come round with me now."
</p>

<p>
"Why not go by yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I am a married man," replied Saunders,
"and I want a chaperon."  And together the two
men left the still noisy house and made their way to
the stage door.
</p>

<p>
Under the guidance of a pale youth in a shabby
pony coat, they entered a gloomy passage, ascended a
steep flight of stone steps, and halted before a door,
which had once been painted green.
</p>

<p>
The pale one knocked, and a clear musical voice
gave the necessary permission to enter.
</p>

<p>
A naturally bare and ugly room had been rendered
attractive by a big stove, several comfortable chairs,
and an abundance of photographs, unframed sketches
and artistic knick-knacks.  It had been rendered still
more attractive by the presence of a charming young
lady, who was engaged&mdash;with the assistance of her
dresser&mdash;in removing all traces of "make-up" from
her comely lips and cheeks.
</p>

<p>
The lady in question came forward with an air of
pleasurable excitement, and smiling a warm welcome to
the Englishman, cried:
</p>

<p>
"So you <i>have</i> come, Herr Saunders!  You have
not, then, altogether forgotten the winter of 1904?"
</p>

<p>
Saunders took the small hand which had been
extended to him and bowed low over it.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven forbid, my dear Princess&mdash;or must I call
you Fräulein Schmitt, now?  No, indeed, so long as I
have memory cells and the power to consult them, I
shall never forget the winter of 1904.  It gave me an
angel for a wife, a king for a friend, and&mdash;must I say
it&mdash;a princess for an enemy.  That fierce enmity!  It
is by no means my least pleasurable remembrance.
There was so much fun in it, such irresponsible laughter,
that it all seems now more like the struggle of
children for a toy castle than anything else."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but you forget that I lost a dear father and
a loved brother in the struggle for that toy castle!"  There
was almost a life-time of sorrow in the young
girl's voice.
</p>

<p>
Again Saunders bent his head.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, Princess," he said, "I did not forget
that, nor the fact that you nearly lost your life, and
I mine.  But my memory loves rather to linger on the
bob-sleighing excursions, the tea-fights at Frau Mengler's,
the frivolous disputations and serious frivolities&mdash;all
with such a delicious substratum of intrigue."
</p>

<p>
"You have a convenient memory, mein Herr," she
said quietly.  "You remember the bright things, you
half remember the grey, the black you entirely forget."
</p>

<p>
Saunders' smile faded, for there was still a touch of
sadness in the girl's words.  Under the circumstances
it was not unnatural, but he thought it more considerate
to keep the interview from developing on serious
lines.
</p>

<p>
"The art of living is to choose one's memories," he
said lightly.  "He who has conquered his thoughts,
has conquered a more wonderful country than Grimland."
</p>

<p>
"And so marriage has made of you a philosopher,
Herr Saunders?" she returned, her soft lips curling a
trifle contemptuously.  "Well, perhaps you are right&mdash;if
we take life as a jest, death, then, is only the
peal of laughter that follows the jest."  And then,
turning to the American, she chided Saunders with:
"But you have not presented your friend!"
</p>

<p>
"I must again crave pardon&mdash;I had quite forgotten
him," apologised Saunders.  "Your Highness, may I
present my very good friend, Mr. George Trafford of
New York&mdash;the winner of the King's Cup."
</p>

<p>
The American bowed low before this exquisite creature;
then uplifting his head and shoulders and twirling
his moustache&mdash;a habit he had when his emotions
were at all stirred&mdash;he asked with true American
directness:
</p>

<p>
"Am I speaking to a princess of the blood royal
or to a princess of song?"
</p>

<p>
The princess and the Englishman quickly exchanged
amused glances, and a moment later there came from
the girl a ringing laugh, a delightful laugh bubbling
over with humour, with not a hint of the sorrow or
the bitterness of a few moments before, while Saunders
hastened to say:
</p>

<p>
"Both, my American friend!  You are addressing
the high-born Princess Gloria von Schattenberg, cousin
to his Majesty King Karl of Grimland!"
</p>

<p>
"Then I congratulate the high-born princess less
on her high birth than on her inimitable gift of song,"
said the American gallantly.
</p>

<p>
The Princess acknowledged the felicitation with a
bewitching smile.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Herr Trafford," she said simply.  "It
is better to be a music-hall star in the ascendant than
a princess in exile&mdash;it is far more profitable, isn't
it?"  No answer was expected, and in a trice her mood
changed again.  "When I fled the country three years
ago, Herr Trafford," she continued, "I was penniless&mdash;my
father dead, and his estates confiscated.  True,
an allowance&mdash;a mere pittance&mdash;might have been mine
had I returned and bowed the knee to Karl."  She
stopped, her feelings seemingly too much for her; in
a moment, however, she had mastered them.  "But I
was a Schattenberg!" she cried, with a little toss of
her head.  "And the Schattenbergs&mdash;as Herr Saunders
will testify&mdash;are a stiff-necked race.  There was
nothing to be done," she went on, "but develop the
gifts God had given me.  Under an humble nom de
guerre I have achieved notoriety and a large salary.
Germany, France, Belgium, I have toured them all&mdash;and
my incognito has never been pierced.  So when
I got hold of a splendid song I lost no time in
hastening to Weidenbruck, for I knew it would go like
wildfire here."
</p>

<p>
"A most dangerous step."  The comment came
from the American, but there was a light of frank
admiration in his eye.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!" she protested, a faint touch of colour
in her cheek, denoting that his approving glance had
not escaped her.  "It is years since I was in this
place."  And smiling at the Englishman, now, she added
naïvely: "My features are little likely to be recognised."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" voiced Saunders, a touch of satire in his
tone.  "Photographs of the exiled Princess Gloria are
in all the shop-windows, her personality is more than a
tolerably popular one.  When they are placed in
conjunction with those of the equally popular Fräulein
Schmitt, will not people talk?"
</p>

<p>
"I hope they will do more than that," confessed
the Princess, growing excited.
</p>

<p>
"You want&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"I want Grimland," interrupted the Princess; and
added loftily: "nothing more and nothing less.  You
will have me arrested?"
</p>

<p>
"Not yet!" declared Saunders with his brightest
smile.  "The night is cold&mdash;your dressing-room is cosy.
No, my fascinating, and revolutionary young lady, the
truce between us has been so long unbroken that I
cannot rush into hostilities in this way.  Besides, we
are not now in 1904, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, for 1904!" cried the Princess, her eyes ablaze
with the light of enthusiasm.  "Oh, for the sweets of
popularity, the ecstasy of rousing brave men and
turning their blood to wine and their brains to fire!  I
want to live, to rule, to be obeyed and loved as a
queen!"
</p>

<p>
In an instant Trafford felt a responsive glow; he
started to speak but Saunders already was speaking.
</p>

<p>
"Princess," the Englishman was saying coldly,
"popularity is champagne with a dash of brandy in
it.  It is a splendid pick-me-up.  It dispels ennui,
migraine, and all the other troubles of a highly-strung,
nervous system.  Only, it is not what medical folk call
a 'food.'  It does not do for breakfast, luncheon and
dinner.  After a time it sickens."
</p>

<p>
"Popularity&mdash;the adulation of my people would
never pall on me," returned the Princess, gazing off
for the moment, absorbed in a realm of dreams.
</p>

<p>
"No, but the police might take a hand," intimated
Saunders grimly.  "There is a castle at Weidenbruck
called the Strafeburg.  As its name implies, it is
intended otherwise than as a pleasure residence.  It is
a picturesque old pile, but, curiously enough, the
architect seems to have neglected the important
requirements of light and air.  You would get very tired of
the Strafeburg, my Princess!"
</p>

<p>
"The people of Paris got very tired of the Bastille,"
retorted the Princess hotly and flashing a defiant look
at the Englishman.  Trafford's hand clinched in
sympathy for her.  Never was maid so splendidly daring
and reckless and fascinating!  "They got very tired
of Louis XVI.," the voice was still going on, "and the
people of Weidenbruck are very tired of the Strafeburg."
</p>

<p>
To Trafford's astonishment the Princess's eyes
showed danger of filling upon uttering these last words.
Her perfect mouth quivered, and of a sudden, she
seemed to him younger&mdash;certainly not more than nineteen.
Again he was tempted to interfere in her behalf,
but again Saunders was before him.
</p>

<p>
"They got tired of a good many people in Paris,"
the Englishman said slowly.  "Ultimately, even of
Mére Guillotine.  But supposing this country rose,
pulled down the Strafeburg and other interesting relics,
and decapitated my excellent friend, the King;
supposing after much cutting of throats, burning of
buildings, and shootings against the wall, a certain young
lady became Gloria the First of Grimland, do you
imagine she would be happy?  No&mdash;in twelve months she
would be bored to death with court etiquette, with
conflicting advice, and the servile flattery of interested
intriguers.  Believe me, she is far happier enchanting
the audiences of Belgium and Germany than she would
be in velvet and ermine and a gold crown that fell off
every time she indulged in one of her irresponsible fits
of merriment."
</p>

<p>
"I might forget to laugh," said the Princess sadly.
"But no, I cannot, will not, take your advice!  Do
you not suppose that nature intended me to fill a loftier
position than even the high firmament of the <i>Café
Chantant</i>?  No, a thousand times no, Herr Saunders&mdash;I
am a Schattenberg and I mean to fight!"
</p>

<p>
The American could not restrain himself an instant
longer.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!" burst out Trafford enthusiastically.
"There's a ring in that statement that warms my heart
tremendously!"
</p>

<p>
A swift frown clouded Saunders' brow.  It was plain
to see that the Englishman was much annoyed at the
American's outspoken approval of the Princess's
purpose; but she broke into the laughter of a
mischief-loving child.
</p>

<p>
"And <i>you</i>&mdash;are not you a friend of King Karl?"
she inquired of Trafford, while a new light shone in her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
The American gave a furious twist to his moustache
before answering.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Saunders, I believe, has recommended me as
his Commander-in-Chief," he said with mock gravity,
"but the appointment has not yet been confirmed.  'Till
then my services are at the disposal of the highest
bidder."
</p>

<p>
"My American friend's services are of problematic
value," put in Saunders, recovering his temper.  "He
is an excellent skater, but a questionable general.  He
has had an exciting day and a superb dinner.  With
your permission I will take him back to his bed at the
Hôtel Concordia."
</p>

<p>
The Princess had not taken her eyes off of the
American since he had last spoken.
</p>

<p>
"He has energy," she mused, looking into space
now, "also the capacity for inspiring enthusiasm, and
I am not at all sure that he has not the instinct of a
born tactician."
</p>

<p>
"But I am," Saunders broke in bluntly.  "Princess,
we have the honour of wishing you good-night!"
</p>

<p>
The Princess laid a delicate hand on the
Englishman's arm.
</p>

<p>
"Herr Saunders," she said, "I will ask you to see
me home."
</p>

<p>
Saunders shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"You must excuse me," he said.  "To-night, I am
neutral, but neutral only.  I am the King's guest and
must not aid the King's enemies."
</p>

<p>
"Good loyal man!" exclaimed the Princess.  "<i>Plus
royalist que le roi!</i>"  And then turning to the
American: "And Herr Trafford?  He will not refuse to
perform a small act of courtesy?"
</p>

<p>
"Trafford accompanies me!" declared Saunders
firmly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm hanged if he does!" spoke up Trafford.  "The
lady wants to be seen home&mdash;and I'm going to do it if
I swing for it!"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-066"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-066.jpg" alt="&quot;The lady wants to be seen home--and I'm going to do it if I swing for it!&quot;">
<br>
&quot;The lady wants to be seen home&mdash;and I'm going<br>
to do it if I swing for it!&quot;
</p>

<p>
The Princess transferred her hand to Trafford's arm.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," she said with a bewilderingly grateful
look up into his face.
</p>

<p>
"Nervy, you're a fool&mdash;a bigger fool than ever I
believed you to be!" exploded Saunders.
</p>

<p>
Trafford's only answer was a most complacent grin.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, Herr Saunders!" said the Princess
in the sweetest of accents.  "Remember me kindly to
your wife and other Royalists.  We may meet again
or not&mdash;my impression is that we shall....  If
so, remember that laughter is not always a symptom
of child's play."
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, Princess!" returned Saunders with
an exaggerated low bow.  "Forgive me, won't you, if
I take the threatened revolution lightly?  The
possibility of your sitting on the throne of Grimland," he
went on with another obeisance, "opens up such
delightful prospect that I shall fight against it with only
half a heart.  Still, I shall fight against it.
Good-night, Prin&mdash;Your Majesty!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER SEVEN
<br><br>
CONFIDENCES IN A WINE SHOP
</h3>

<p>
Nervy Trafford&mdash;comfortably covered by a warm
rug, seated in an open sleigh next to a young lady of
exalted birth, romantic temperament, and unimpeachable
comeliness&mdash;was almost a happy man.  It was
not that he had fallen in love at first sight, that he had
found swift consolation for his recent disappointment in
a rapidly-engendered passion for the fascinating claimant
to the throne of Grimland, that he was capable of
offering any woman the fine spiritual worship he had
accorded to the adorable Angela Knox; but to his
temperament admiration came easily&mdash;and he had dined
well.  He had been the auditor of a wildly exciting song,
had made the acquaintance of the inimitable singer,
and because there was wine and music in his blood, and
much beauty by his side, the nightmare of his past
depression vanished into the biting air, and his pulses
stirred to a Hit of amazing exhilaration.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" he exclaimed to himself, stealing a side
glance at his companion's bewitching profile, "Saunders
is right&mdash;life is too valuable an asset to fling away in
a moment's madness.  There is a beauty of the body
and a beauty of the soul, and if the two are perfectly
combined in only one woman in the universe, is that any
reason why I should not admire a tip-tilted nose or a
curved mouth when Fate puts them within a hand's
breadth of my own scrubby cheek?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you know Weidenbruck, Herr Trafford?" the
Princess broke in on his silent philosophising.
</p>

<p>
"Little beyond the Hôtel Concordia," he replied.
"Where are we now?"
</p>

<p>
"The Domkircheplatz.  That is the Cathedral."
</p>

<p>
They were crossing a big open space, well lit, planted
with trees, and adorned in its centre by a big group
of statuary.  To their right was a huge gothic
building&mdash;a high ridged intricate structure of red
sandstone&mdash;with a tangle of fretted pinnacles and flying
buttresses, and a couple of lofty towers that stood out
black against the starry heaven.
</p>

<p>
"A fine building!" commented the American.
</p>

<p>
"That is where I am going to be crowned," said
the Princess, and she laughed a fine, free, silvery laugh
that thrilled her companion with admiration.
</p>

<p>
"That's the right spirit," he said gaily; "and
what's this depressing-looking place in front of
us?"
</p>

<p>
"That's where I shall probably be confined," was
the cheerful retort.
</p>

<p>
The building in question occupied the entire side of
the square, and was as gloomy as it was vast.  It was
a plain rectangular structure totally devoid of
ornament, and constructed of enormous blocks of rough
hewn stone; irregularly spaced windows broke its
sombre front with narrow slits and iron gratings, and a
high-pitched roof of ruddy tiles crowned the grim
precipice of enduring masonry.
</p>

<p>
"That's the Strafeburg," concluded the Princess,
"the Bastille of Weidenbruck!"
</p>

<p>
"I see myself rescuing you from that topmost
window," ventured Trafford.
</p>

<p>
The Princess turned half round and looked at him
curiously.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," she murmured, "but I shall keep outside
as long as I can.  As a foreigner you should visit
it&mdash;as a sight-seer.  It is a most depressing place, but
there is a very valuable collection of armour and a
collection of instruments of torture without its equal
in Europe."
</p>

<p>
"Is it still used as a prison?" asked Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"They <i>say</i> not."  There was a meaning behind her
qualified denial and Trafford demanded it.  "Between
official statements and actual facts there is apt to be a
serious discrepancy in this unfortunate land," she
replied.  "Officially, no one resides in the Strafeburg
but the caretaker and his daughter.  As a matter of
fact, I am told that several political prisoners are still
rotting in its dungeons."
</p>

<p>
Trafford shuddered.  He was a very humane man,&mdash;despite
his explosive temperament.  His companion
noted keenly the effect of her words, and went on:
</p>

<p>
"Officially, also, the instruments of torture went out
of use one hundred and fifty years ago."
</p>

<p>
"You mean&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I mean," she continued, "that our dear humane
monarch does not stick at trifles when his interests are
threatened."
</p>

<p>
Trafford opened his eyes wide, and regarded his
companion with amazement.  In his curious, excitable
brain was a largely developed loathing of cruelty.
Hard knocks he was prepared to give or receive in the
world's battle, big risks to life and limb he was
prepared to incur or inflict with heedless impartiality, but
deliberate cruelty, the malicious and intentional
infliction of pain on man or brute, always roused him
to a frenzy of wrath.  The Princess read his look and
silence.
</p>

<p>
"The Archbishop of Weidenbruck, a political opponent
of King Karl's, is said to have met a peculiarly
terrible end," she said meaningly.
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!" muttered Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"Impossible things happen in Grimland.  It is
impossible, of course, that you should side against your
friend, Herr Saunders, and your prospective friend,
King Karl&mdash;&mdash;" and she touched his hand with an
unconscious impulsive movement,&mdash;"and help me in my
legitimate ambitions."
</p>

<p>
Her words were in the nature of a suggestion, almost
a question.
</p>

<p>
Trafford answered them between his teeth.
</p>

<p>
"That is the sort of impossibility that comes off,"
he muttered.
</p>

<p>
"You mean it?" demanded his fair companion, and
her eyes were pleading as they had pleaded with
Captain von Hügelweiler in the Thiergarten.
</p>

<p>
Trafford drank deep of their glance, and it
intoxicated him.
</p>

<p>
"When I see these picturesque buildings," he
returned, "with their garlands of snow and cornices of
icicles, I feel I am in fairyland.  And in fairyland, you
know, the poor beast is changed into a handsome young
man and marries the beautiful Princess."  He was not
insensible of his boldness, and carried it off with a
laugh.  "I feel the transmogrifying effects of this
fairy kingdom already."
</p>

<p>
"And you are beginning to feel a handsome young
man?" asked the Princess gaily.
</p>

<p>
"I have felt it this past quarter of an hour, Princess,"
he answered, twirling at his frozen moustache.
"Already wild hopes are stirring in my bosom."
</p>

<p>
"You are not going to propose, are you?" she
asked calmly, but with a most delicious quiver of the
lips.
</p>

<p>
Trafford looked at his fair interrogator steadily
a few seconds before replying.  If ever encouragement
was legible in bright eyes and challenging smile, it was
writ clear in the facile features of the Princess von
Schattenberg.  Again he drank deep of beauty and
his brain reeled among the stars.
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly a proposal, but I'll make you a proposition,"
he said in a voice typically American in its
business-like tone.
</p>

<p>
They had entered a narrow side street, and the driver
was pulling up his horse before a disreputable-looking
wine shop.  Dismissing the sleigh the Princess led the
way into the building through a low, malodorous
room&mdash;where a number of men were swilling beery
smoking, and playing dominoes&mdash;and penetrated to
inner chamber.
</p>

<p>
"And is this your home?" inquired Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"One of them," was the reply.  "An outlaw must
sleep where she can&mdash;it's wise to vary one's abode."
</p>

<p>
An old man in shirt-sleeves and apron entered the
room and demanded their pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"We want nothing except solitude," said the Princess.
"May we have that, Herr Krantz?"
</p>

<p>
"Most certainly, your High&mdash;&mdash;, gracious lady.
You will not be interrupted unless&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, good Herr Krantz, I understand."
</p>

<p>
The old landlord inclined his bald head and quitted
the shabby apartment.  The Princess motioned to her
companion to be seated, pointing to a chair at a small
table, then taking a seat opposite him, she rested her
pretty head on her hands, her elbows resting on the
table, and surprised him by suddenly popping out:
</p>

<p>
"And now about that proposition of yours&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Trafford's countenance indicated that he thought
that the bantering note in her voice and words was
distinctly out-of-place, but notwithstanding he drew his
chair closer and began:
</p>

<p>
"Princess, we have not known each other long&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We have not known each other at all," she quickly
interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me," corrected Trafford, with a fierce
energy that always possessed him at a crisis.  "You
diagnosed me admirably in your dressing-room at the
Eden Theatre.  With equal perspicacity I have
diagnosed you on our frosty drive hither.  Shall I
tell it?&mdash;yes?  Well, then, a nature ardent but pure,
fierce without being cruel, simple without being foolish.
I see youth, birth and beauty blended into one
exhilarating whole&mdash;and I bow down and worship.  To
a heart like yours, nothing is impossible&mdash;not even the
capacity of falling in love with an adventurous American.
I do not make you a proposal of marriage, but
a matrimonial proposition."  He paused to note the
effect of his words before concluding with: "Now
then, if by my efforts I can secure for you the throne
of Grimland, will you reward me with your heart and
hand?"
</p>

<p>
The Princess drew in a long breath, half-astonishment,
half-admiration.
</p>

<p>
"That is one of the impossibilities that does not
come off&mdash;even in Grimland," she told him at last.
</p>

<p>
"Listen," Trafford went on impetuously, "I shall
only ask for my reward in the event of your being
crowned in the Cathedral of Weidenbruck, and in the
event of your acknowledging of your own free will
that I have been mainly instrumental in winning you
your sovereignty."
</p>

<p>
The Princess bit her lips and nodded silently, as if
weighing his words.  Something, however, impelled her
to make the obvious objection.
</p>

<p>
"In the event of my being crowned Queen of Grimland,"
she reminded him, "I shall not be permitted to
marry whom I will.  If I married you without the
consent of my counsellors and Parliament the
marriage would be, <i>ipso facto</i>, null and void."
</p>

<p>
"All I ask is your promise to go through the ceremony
with the necessary legal and religious forms."
</p>

<p>
The Princess remained a moment in silent thought.
Then she broke out into her merriest laugh.
</p>

<p>
"We are building castles in the air," she hastened
to say.  "Yes, I promise&mdash;on those conditions.  But
you perceive the badness of the bargain you are
making?  A marriage that will be no marriage&mdash;a
contract that will not be worth the paper it is written
on?"
</p>

<p>
"I will chance its validity."
</p>

<p>
"In that event and on those conditions you shall
have my hand."
</p>

<p>
The Princess stretched forth her right hand.
</p>

<p>
Trafford took it and pressed his lips to it.
</p>

<p>
"And heart?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
As in the Thiergarten with Von Hügelweiler, the
Princess Gloria hesitated momentarily, but long
enough for the framing of a lie.  But this time something
strangled the conceived falsehood before it passed
her lips.
</p>

<p>
"Alas!" she faltered.  "Nature forgot to give me a
heart."  The words were seriously enough spoken, but
somehow they did not ring true to him.
</p>

<p>
"You are incapable of love?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The Princess flushed deeply as slowly she scanned
the man who faced her.  It was patent that a battle
was raging in her heaving bosom.  For a full half-minute
silence reigned, a silence broken only by faint
murmurs and the clink of beer glasses from the outer
room.  And all the time Trafford's face preserved an
expressionless immobility, his eyes a gleam of stern
directness.  The Princess heaved a deep sigh.  The
battle was over; something was lost, something was
won.
</p>

<p>
"Herr Trafford," she began in a mechanical voice,
"I want to tell you the history of my maiden fancies.
At the age of seventeen&mdash;when staying at Weissheim,
at my father's schloss, the Marienkastel&mdash;I fell in love
with a young officer in the Guides.  He was handsome,
aristocratic, a gallant man with a refined nature and
a superb athlete as well.  He loved me dearly&mdash;was
more to me than my father, mother or anyone or
anything in the kingdom of Grimland.  But my infatuation
was divined, and we were separated.  I wept,
I stormed, I vowed nothing would ever comfort me.
Nevertheless, in six months I was a happy, laughing
girl again with an intense love of life, and only an
occasional stab of regret for a heart I had sworn to call
my own."
</p>

<p>
Trafford's face showed his sympathy, but he did
not speak.
</p>

<p>
"Then came the winter of 1904," the Princess went
on with the same unemotional tone.  "In our unsuccessful
rebellion of that fatal winter an Englishman
performed prodigies of valor.  It was mainly owing
to his foresight and daring that King Karl saved his
throne&mdash;and my father and brother met death instead
of the crown that was within their grasp.  Later, it is
true, this same Englishman saved my life and procured
my escape from Grimland.  But, even so, would
any girl not dowered by Providence with a fickle
disposition permit any feeling to dwell in her heart other
than hate and horror for such a man?  And yet, I was
on the point of experiencing something more than
admiration for this fearless Englishman, a second
conquest of my heart was imminent"&mdash;she paused to
scrutinise the face of the man at her side, watching
keenly for some signs of disapproval&mdash;"when it was
nipped in the bud, strangled in its infancy, if ever
there, by his choosing a mate elsewhere.  So, once
again I was fancy free.  What then is love&mdash;my love?"
she exclaimed wistfully.  "A gust that blusters and
dies down, a swift passing thunder-storm, a mocking
dream,"&mdash;her voice quavered and sank,&mdash;"a false
vision of a sun that never rose on plain or on mountain."
</p>

<p>
Trafford met the sadness of her gaze with eyes that
twinkled with a strange kindliness.  The story of her
life had moved him strongly.  At the beginning of their
interview he had felt like a seafarer listening to the
voice of the siren.  He had been bartering his strength
and manhood for the silken joys of a woman's allurements.
His native shrewdness had told him that he
was being enticed less for himself than the usufruct
of his brain and muscles; but the bait was so sweet
that his exalted senses had deemed it more than worthy
of the price he paid.  Had the Princess Gloria avowed
a deep and spontaneous passion for him, he would not
have believed her; but he would have been content,
and well content, with the agreeable lie.  But she had
been honest with him,&mdash;honest to the detriment of her
own interest.
</p>

<p>
"You don't dislike me, do you?" he blurted out, at
length.
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary," she responded frankly, "I like
you well, Herr Trafford."
</p>

<p>
"It would be sad otherwise," he sighed, "for I like
you exceedingly well."
</p>

<p>
And at that she put her hand bravely on his shoulder
and smiled at him.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, comrade," she told him, "your heart
is big enough and warm enough for two."
</p>

<p>
"<i>My</i> heart!" he exclaimed in a most lugubrious
way, "my heart is several degrees colder than the ice
on the Rundsee;" and added with terrible lack of tact:
"whatever of warmth and fire it possessed was
extinguished last Christmas Eve."
</p>

<p>
The Princess removed her hand from his shoulder
in a manner that should have left no doubt in his mind
of the thought behind it.
</p>

<p>
"Princess," he went blindly on, "you have told
me your story, let me tell you mine&mdash;it is brevity
itself."
</p>

<p>
The Princess inclined her head.
</p>

<p>
"I fell in love with a young lady named Angela
Knox&mdash;an American;"&mdash;and his tone was fully as
responsible as his words for bringing his companion's
eyes back to his with something of the scorn his clumsy
love-making deserved;&mdash;"the young lady, Angela
Knox, refused me.  I tried to blow my brains out, but
Fate and Saunders willed otherwise.  The latter
advised Grimland as a hygienic antidote to <i>felo de se</i>.
Behold, then," he concluded with a sigh, "an
able-bodied man with an icicle in his breast!"
</p>

<p>
Trafford spread out his hands in an explanatory
gesture, and then for the first time he noted the heightened
colour in the Princess's cheek, that her eyes were
aflame, and that an explosion of some kind was
imminent.
</p>

<p>
"And you had the impudence to make love to me!"
she cried in that wonderful voice that had captivated
audiences with every intonation, from the angry tones
of a jealous grisette to the caressing notes of the
ingenue.  "To amuse yourself by feigning a pure
devotion&mdash;&mdash;"  But the Princess's words failed her,
and the hand of a Schattenberg was raised so
threateningly,&mdash;at any rate, so it seemed to Trafford&mdash;that
in surprise and consternation he rose from his
chair, and as he did so, his head came in contact with
the electric light, which hung low from the dingy
ceiling.  Simultaneously the white fire in the glass bulb
was extinguished to a thin, dull red line, and in two
seconds they were in total darkness.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER EIGHT
<br><br>
THE BARGAIN
</h3>

<p>
For several seconds Trafford stood silent in the
darkness, thinking furiously.  What was the correct thing
to say or do in such an unusual, almost painful, situation,
he had not the faintest idea.  But before speech
suggested itself to his puzzled brain, his companion&mdash;not
wholly successful in smothering the merriment that
had instantly replaced her affectation of anger&mdash;had
checked him with a warning "hush!"
</p>

<p>
Noiselessly the Princess tiptoed to the glazed partition
that separated the inner chamber from the wine-shop,
and drawing back a curtain gazed cautiously
through the chink.
</p>

<p>
A couple of men&mdash;as indigent in appearance as the
rest of the throng&mdash;had entered the shop and were
talking to the landlord.  The latter was all civility
and smiles, but his customers were regarding the
newcomers with glances of deep suspicion and resentment.
</p>

<p>
After gazing a few seconds, the Princess returned to
Trafford, and taking him by the hand led him rapidly
through another door into a street at the back.
</p>

<p>
"Krantz extinguished the light," she whispered.
"It was not your head, stupid, that did it!  It was
the danger-signal agreed upon between us&mdash;there are
a couple of police agents in the shop."
</p>

<p>
The touch of melodrama delighted Trafford, and
the presence of danger destroyed much of his
embarrassment.  They were in a narrow lane, lighted at
rare intervals, and half choked with snow.  A bitter
wind blew cheerlessly between lofty houses, but the
stars burned clearly in the deep violet of the heavens.
</p>

<p>
"Where now?" he asked briefly.
</p>

<p>
"Home," answered the Princess curtly.  "I'm going
home&mdash;good-night!"
</p>

<p>
Trafford stood irresolute.  A hand was offered him
in farewell.  It might be tactless to enforce his society
any longer, but there were reasons&mdash;the hour and the
gloom of the street if nothing else&mdash;why he could not
leave her alone.
</p>

<p>
"I promised to see you home," he protested stubbornly.
"I keep my promises."
</p>

<p>
"You are foolish," she returned, accepting the
situation and walking briskly down the street.  "This
quarter of Weidenbruck is anything but a safe one,
despite its present tranquillity.  There are queer folk
dwelling in these gabled old houses&mdash;men who live by
the knife and the garote!  You would be wise to
reseek the civilisation of the Hôtel Concordia."
</p>

<p>
"Is it necessary to insult me?" bristling.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but you found it necessary to insult me!" she
retorted.
</p>

<p>
"In what way?" staring at her in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"By making love&mdash;such love!  You nearly blow
your brains out for a silly American girl, and then have
the impertinence to ask me&mdash;me, the Princess Gloria
von Schattenberg&mdash;to marry you, informing me
casually that your heart is dead and cold."
</p>

<p>
"But your heart is dead and cold, too," he argued
fatuously.  "And you were not willing to accept me.
It seems that we are in the same boat.  We offered
too little, and we asked too much."
</p>

<p>
The Princess was momentarily silenced by his logic;
womanlike, however, she refused to let things end in a
logical conclusion.
</p>

<p>
"I am terribly angry with you," she persisted,
nevertheless, with what Trafford could have sworn was a
veritable wink.
</p>

<p>
"So I was led to suppose," he replied, rubbing his
head.
</p>

<p>
His words and their accompanying action, tickled
the Princess's risibilities, always lying just beneath the
surface.  She bit her lips in a desperate effort to
control, but in a moment her fine, fearless laugh rang out
merrily in the deserted street.  Trafford gazed in
amazement at his volatile companion, and then he
laughed, too.
</p>

<p>
"Don't imagine that I am not angry because I'm
laughing," declared the Princess.  "I
have&mdash;unfortunately, perhaps&mdash;a painfully acute sense of
humour.  I very often laugh when I am feeling most
deeply."
</p>

<p>
But Trafford having commenced to laugh, gave
way to roars of laughter.  He had been accorded such
varied treatment, such swiftly-changing moods, that
he was quite uncertain as to what the next moment
would bring forth; and the atmosphere of political
intrigue and romantic adventure&mdash;with its picturesque
setting of ancient houses and deep snow&mdash;lifted him
into such regions of pure unreality that he laughed
for very joy at the exhilarating absurdity of it all.
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott!  To think I have lived eight-and-twenty
years without discovering Grimland!" he exclaimed
when able to catch his breath.  "Princess,
you must indeed forgive me....  It seems, besides
dead hearts, we have in common a most lively
sense of the ridiculous."
</p>

<p>
"I'll forgive you when you have seen me home," she
replied.  "But I absolutely repudiate the bargain we
made at Herr Krantz's wine shop.  We may have
much in common ... but surely you don't suppose
that I would marry a man with a dead heart?"
</p>

<p>
"As to the bargain, I surmised as much when you
raised your hand to&mdash;&mdash;" he broke off suddenly, and
then added: "I suppose the deal is off, then?  Well,
perhaps it's just as well for both of us.  May I ask
where your home is?"
</p>

<p>
"My home&mdash;my home for to-night&mdash;is there," said
the Princess, pointing across the street to an entrance,
which bore the number forty-two.
</p>

<p>
Trafford looked up at a venerable structure, which
raised its steep gable somewhat higher than its
neighbours.
</p>

<p>
Light shone from a window on the second story.
Otherwise the façade showed a blank front of closed
shutters.  Just as they were crossing the
snow-encumbered road, a couple of men halted before the
door in question, and one of them knocked loudly.
The Princess and Trafford stopped automatically.
Both scented danger, one from experience, the other
from instinct.  A friendly archway afforded complete
concealment, and there, sheltered alike from gaze and
the bitter wind, they awaited developments.
</p>

<p>
Trafford felt his arm gripped tight by a little hand,
either from excitement or from a desire for protection.
</p>

<p>
"Those are Meyer's men," whispered the Princess.
</p>

<p>
Trafford nodded in reply.  He was humming the
Rothlied softly between his teeth.  They watched
for a silent moment, and then a woman answered the
door.  After a moment's palaver, the men went in.
Simultaneously two more men glided into view from
some invisible hiding-place, and took up their
positions one on each side of the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"Are you armed?" asked the Princess in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
Trafford's eyes were like stars for brightness.
</p>

<p>
"I have my fists," he answered.
</p>

<p>
The Princess produced a tiny revolver from a satin
handbag, which she pressed on her companion.
</p>

<p>
Trafford declined it curtly.
</p>

<p>
"I have my fists," he repeated.
</p>

<p>
The Princess regarded him with astonishment and
a recrudescence of anger.
</p>

<p>
"They are trying to take my friend," she expostulated
in low tones.  "They will probably murder
him.  It is essential to my success that he escapes
their clutches."
</p>

<p>
"He'll escape all right," said Trafford, with the
unreasoning confidence of the born optimist; but the
Princess stamped with annoyance at his folly.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly sounds of a struggle were heard from the
direction of the lighted window on the second
floor&mdash;sounds of shifting feet and reeling furniture, but no
cry of human throat or crack of firearm.
</p>

<p>
"I must investigate this," said Trafford, but before
he could take action there was a great crash of riven
glass, and a dark form fell rolling and clutching from
the shattered window into the street.  The fall was
considerable, but the snow broke its force, and the
man stirred where he lay.
</p>

<p>
"Is it he?" asked the Princess breathlessly.  "No,
thank God!" she answered herself as the man raised
a bearded face from the snow, and groaned in agony.
</p>

<p>
"Look out!" said Trafford, for there were sounds
of men descending a staircase at breakneck speed, and
as he spoke a dark form issued from the doorway.
As it did so, one of the two men who were waiting
without, threw a cloak over the head and arms of the
emerging man.  Simultaneously the other raised a
weapon and struck.  A half-second later and another
man issued from the house, and leaped like a wild
beast on the back of the enmeshed and stricken man.
</p>

<p>
This was too much for Trafford's tingling nerves.
Leaving the Princess where she stood in the archway,
he darted across the road with the speed of a football
end going down the field under a punt to tackle the
opposing fullback.  His passage was rendered noiseless
by the soft carpet of thick snow, and he arrived
unseen and unheard at the scene of the mêlée.  The
man with the dagger was just about to strike again.
He had been making desperate efforts to do so for
several moments, but his would-be victim was struggling
like a trapped tiger, and the heaving, writhing mass
of humanity, wherein aggressors and quarry were
inextricably entangled, offered no safe mark for the
assassin's steel.  However, just as his point was raised
aloft with desperate intent, Trafford anticipated his
action with a swinging blow on the side of the head.
The man fell, dazed and stunned, against the wall.
Trafford, with his fighting lust now thoroughly
inflamed, turned his instant attention to the other
aggressors.  Now, however, he had no unprepared victim
for his vigorous arm.  A vile-looking ruffian, with
low brow and matted hair, had extricated himself from
the involved struggle, and was feeling for a broad
knife that lay ready to hand in his leather belt.
</p>

<p>
With the swift acumen born of pressing danger,
Trafford stooped down, and picking up a lump of
frozen snow, dashed it in his enemy's face.  A shrewd
blow in the midriff followed this tactical success, and
further punishment would have befallen the unhappy
man had not his original victim, freed from two of
his three aggressors, gained his feet, and in his effort
to escape, cannoned so violently and unexpectedly into
Trafford, that the enterprising American lost his
balance and fell precipitately into the soft snow.  When
he regained his feet he saw a tall form flying rapidly
down the street, with two assailants in hot pursuit.
</p>

<p>
"You've begun well!" said a soft voice in his ear.
Trafford turned and faced the Princess.
</p>

<p>
"Begun well?" he repeated, brushing the snow from
his person.
</p>

<p>
"A good beginning for your work of winning me
a throne."
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand."
</p>

<p>
"Our bargain is on again," she declared, with
suppressed enthusiasm, "unless you wish it otherwise?"
</p>

<p>
He looked into her fearless eyes, which fell at length
before his own.
</p>

<p>
"We will let it stand," he agreed curtly.  "But
what of your friend?" he went on, "will he get away?"
</p>

<p>
"If he wishes," answered the Princess easily.  "It
would take more than two men to capture Father Bernhardt.
I have no further anxiety on his account, but
what about me&mdash;poor me?"
</p>

<p>
"About you?" he repeated, without understanding.
</p>

<p>
"Where am I to spend the night?"
</p>

<p>
Trafford passed his hand through his ruffled locks,
dislodging therefrom several pieces of frozen snow.
Then he looked at the man who had staggered under
his blow against the wall, and who was eyeing them
with a malignancy that bespoke rapid recuperation.
The man who had fallen into the street had risen to
his knees and was muttering something&mdash;a curse or
a prayer&mdash;and might speedily exchange speech for
action.  The two pursuers of Father Bernhardt might
return,&mdash;baffled of their prey and breathing
threatenings and slaughter,&mdash;at any moment.
</p>

<p>
Trafford grasped the Princess's hand and dragged
her across the street.
</p>

<p>
"Herr Krantz's wine shop," he insisted.
</p>

<p>
"Is in the occupation of spies," retorted the Princess.
</p>

<p>
"Then what&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"The Hôtel Concordia," proposed the Princess calmly.
</p>

<p>
"The Hôtel Concordia!" he echoed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Your sister has just arrived from England
and wants a small room at the top of the house.  Her
luggage, naturally, has gone astray.  You are a friend
of Herr Saunders, and consequently above suspicion.
Do not be alarmed, my friend, I shall leave early and
I will pay for my bed and breakfast."
</p>

<p>
Trafford tugged each moustache violently in turn.
</p>

<p>
"So be it," he said at length.  "It is all part of
the bargain.  Come, little new-found sister, let us find
a sleigh to drive us to the Hôtel Concordia."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER NINE
<br><br>
THE KING'S BREAKFAST
</h3>

<p>
Like most members of the kingly caste, Karl XXII. was
a big eater and an early riser.  On the morning
following Trafford's adventures in the slums of
Weidenbruck, the genial monarch was breakfasting on
innumerable fried eggs and abundant grilled ham at
the early hour of seven.  He was dressed in high, white
leggings, stout boots, and a dark brown woollen jersey;
and the reason of his athletic attire was a suggested
ski-ing expedition in the neighbourhood of Nussheim,&mdash;a
small village some ten miles distant from the capital.
His Majesty was breakfasting alone save for his
faithful major-domo, Herr Bomcke, an old gentleman of
great dignity and superb whiskers.  Bomcke moved
noiselessly about the room, with one eye on his royal
master's needs, and the other on the doorway, which
was guarded by a young officer in a snow-white uniform
and glistening steel cuirass.  The apartment itself was
the moderate-sized chamber where Karl was wont to
conduct his private affairs.  In one corner stood a
satinwood bureau strewn thick with papers; in another a
marble bust of his father on a malachite pedestal.  Two
entire sides of the room were devoted to book-shelves,
which contained such diverse treasures as fifteenth-century
bestiaries, "Alice in Wonderland," "Moltke's
History of the Franco-Prussian War," and the
Badminton volume on "Winter Sports."  The whole of
the apartment had a mellow golden tinge, a soft
atmosphere of affluent homeliness and regal respectability.
</p>

<p>
Just as his Majesty was consuming his fourth roll
and honey, there was a whispering in the doorway and
Saunders' name was announced in the mellifluous tones
of the major-domo.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning," began the King.  "You are ready
for our expedition, I perceive."
</p>

<p>
"My family motto is <i>semper paratus</i>&mdash;always
ready," replied Saunders lightly.  "But I understand
our train does not start for Nussheim till 8 A.M.  I
came early because I wished to talk over a delicate
situation with you."
</p>

<p>
"Talk away," said the King, attacking another roll,
and draining his coffee cup.
</p>

<p>
"The Princess Gloria is in Weidenbruck."
</p>

<p>
Karl nodded thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"And her address?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  I did not want to know, so I
refused to see her home last night."
</p>

<p>
Again the King nodded.  He understood his
friend's position perfectly.
</p>

<p>
"The Princess Gloria&mdash;&mdash;" he began, producing
an enormous meerschaum pipe, and proceeding to stuff
it with some dark tobacco.
</p>

<p>
"Is being very closely watched," said a voice from
the doorway.  It was General Meyer, who had entered
unannounced, as was his privilege.
</p>

<p>
"And how about Father Bernhardt?" grunted the
King, puffing at his pipe without looking up.  "He
has been closely watched for some time."
</p>

<p>
"It was about him that I came to speak," said the
General, walking into the middle of the room.
</p>

<p>
"You have taken him, of course," said the King.
"I told you to employ four men."
</p>

<p>
"I followed your Majesty's advice," said Meyer.
"I was wrong.  I should have followed Herr Saunders'.
He advised, if I remember rightly, a battalion of
Guards and a squadron of Dragoons."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to say," demanded the King, with
some warmth, "that four armed men were incapable
of dealing with one priest?"
</p>

<p>
"So it appears," returned Meyer calmly.  "They
say there was some sort of a rescue.  That, of course,
may be a lie to excuse their failure.  Any way, one
of them is suffering from a broken thigh, the result of
a fall from a window.  Another has a dislocated jaw.
Two others,&mdash;who pursued our friend down the
Sichelgasse&mdash;were foolish enough to follow him along the
banks of the Niederkessel.  Fortunately they could
both swim."
</p>

<p>
The King turned with a gesture of impatient
weariness to Saunders.
</p>

<p>
"What do you say?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, what do you say?" said Meyer, putting up
his eyeglass and fixing his glance on the Englishman.
</p>

<p>
Saunders shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say, that there evidently must have been
some sort of a rescue."
</p>

<p>
"A most determined rescue," added Meyer.
</p>

<p>
"A most determined and reckless rescue," affirmed
Saunders, meeting Meyer's glance without flinching.
</p>

<p>
"But your advice, Saunders," said the King.
</p>

<p>
"I gave it you yesterday, sire.  Act!  Hitherto
we have schemed.  We have been patting the mad dog
on the head, but as he still shows his teeth,&mdash;shoot
him!"
</p>

<p>
"Who is the 'him'?" demanded Meyer.  "The
sort of person who rescues rebels when they are being
arrested?"
</p>

<p>
"By mad dog," explained Saunders, "I meant the
snarling, discontented, dangerous element in
Weidenbruck.  We have had plenty of clever schemes for
pacification.  What we want is a little stupid
brutality."
</p>

<p>
"Saunders is right," said the King.  "In theory
I am a Democrat, a Socialist, a believer in the divinity
of the <i>vox populi</i>.  In practice I am a believer in
platoon firing and <i>lettres de cachet</i>.  There are only
two nations in Europe who are genuinely capable of
self-government, and Grimland is not one of them.  We
have tried the velvet glove, and we must show that it
contains a hand of steel, and not a palsied member."
</p>

<p>
"So be it," said Meyer, with a slight inclination of
his head.  "We will give the policy of open repression
a trial, a fair trial and a full trial, and may the God
of Jews and Gentiles teach the loyalists to shoot
straight."
</p>

<p>
Saunders scanned Meyer's face critically.  There
was no colour in his sunken cheek, no fire in his heavy
eye.  The man had no stomach for fighting, and his
complex nature abhorred straightforward measures.
Yet he had proved himself a faithful servant before,
and though life meant more to him than to most
soldiers, he was not one to purchase personal safety by
the betrayal of his sovereign.
</p>

<p>
Again Herr Bomcke upraised his honeyed tones.
</p>

<p>
"Captain von Hügelweiler," he announced.
</p>

<p>
The Captain bowed, and then stood at the salute.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Captain," said his Majesty.  "To
what am I indebted for this honour?"
</p>

<p>
"I wish to send in my papers, sire."
</p>

<p>
"You wish to resign?  What is it?  Money
troubles?"
</p>

<p>
The Captain hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"I am thinking of getting married, sire," he
answered at length.
</p>

<p>
"Young and a bachelor," said the King, "of course
you are thinking of getting married.  That is very
right and proper, but hardly a reason for sending in
your papers."
</p>

<p>
Again Von Hügelweiler was at a loss for words,
and a tinge of colour mounted to his olive cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"I am tired of soldiering," he said, after a long
struggle for thought.
</p>

<p>
"Meyer," said the King, turning to his
Commander-in-Chief, "is not this man a Von Hügelweiler?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, your Majesty.  A member of one of the oldest
and most distinguished families in your kingdom?"
</p>

<p>
"The son of Heinrich Salvator von Hügelweiler,
who fought in the trenches in '84?" persisted the
monarch.
</p>

<p>
Again the Commander-in-Chief replied in the
affirmative.
</p>

<p>
"He is tired of my service, Meyer," went on
King in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler's head sank onto his breast, as if
weighed down with shame.
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty can be served in more ways than
one," he murmured.
</p>

<p>
"But in none so well as by the sword," returned the
King.  "When an officer resigns his commission on
the eve of war we call him by an ugly name, Captain."
</p>

<p>
"But we are not on the eve of war, sire,"
expostulated the poor Captain.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me," said Karl, "I think otherwise."
</p>

<p>
"If there is fighting, sire, my sword is at your
service."
</p>

<p>
"There is fighting and fighting," mused the King.
"Fighting in the long-drawn firing-line with your
nearest comrade ten yards distant, and your nearest
foe a mile off; and there is fighting in the narrow street
with your company shoulder to shoulder, and the
enemy at the end of your swordpoint.  The former
needs courage, but the latter needs courage and a loyal
heart.  Do I make myself clear, Captain von
Hügelweiler?"
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler straightened himself.  Life's
problems seemed very puzzling just now.  He had acted
from the best motives in tendering his resignation, for
if he decided to aid and abet the King's enemies, he
preferred not to do so in the King's uniform.  But the
instincts of a soldier and certain splendid traditions
of his family warred hard with his desires.
</p>

<p>
"I understand my resignation is not acceptable,
your Majesty," he said at length.
</p>

<p>
"I neither refuse it nor accept it," said Karl.
"This morning I am going ski-ing to Nussheim.  I
need protection these troublous times, and I am taking
my Commander-in-Chief with me.  I am taking Herr
Saunders, who is a deadly revolver shot; I am also
taking Mrs. Saunders, who has nerves of steel and the
heart of an Amazon.  Will you make assurance doubly
sure and form part of my body-guard to Nussheim?"
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler's eyes flashed proudly at the
honour, and his hand went to the hilt of his sword.
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty's safety shall be on my head," he
said.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER TEN
<br><br>
A SKI-ING EXPEDITION
</h3>

<p>
Weidenbruck lies in the wildest part of the valley of
the Niederkessel.  On either side,&mdash;at the distance of
several miles&mdash;rise mountains of picturesque outline and
considerable eminence.  Prominent among these stands
the Piz Schadel, a grim giant with a fatal fascination
for those who affect dangerous rock-climbing.  It is on
the lower slopes of the Piz Schadel,&mdash;snug among its
pinewoods, and facing southwards to the sun,&mdash;that
the tiny village of Nussheim is situated.  The little
train that plies between the capital and this sunny
hamlet was fairly crowded,&mdash;despite the earliness of
the hour&mdash;for ski-running is a favourite amusement
of Grimlanders, and the slopes of Nussheim offer an
ideal ground for the exercise of that exhilarating
pastime.  The royal party had a carriage to themselves,
and in due course they steamed through the
outskirts of Weidenbruck, across the flat, snow-covered
plains of the valley, and then mounted by means of a
cog-wheel and a centre rail, to the little yellow station
that was their objective.  A party of tourists in blue
glasses and check ulsters&mdash;Americans, to judge from
the accent and phraseology of their leader, a tall
black-bearded man with a Baedeker&mdash;got out at Nussheim
and proceeded to the local hostelry.  The King and his
companions repaired to a small chalet, where their skis
were awaiting them.  Having shod themselves with
their long footgear, they sallied forth on to the snow.
The sun was just rising above the opposite mountains,
and the scene was one of quite extraordinary beauty.
The air was still and crisp and invigorating, but so
dry on this elevated plateau that there was no sensation
of cold, though the thermometer gave a far lower
reading than at Weidenbruck.  The sky was purest
ultra-marine, and in the perfect air every detail of the
surrounding hills, forest, crag, and hamlet, stood out
with soft distinctness.  And everywhere was snow and
the silence of the snows; white fields of sparkling
purity swelling and falling in smooth stretches of
shimmering argent.  Above were dun precipices and dark
green woods of larch and fir, and above, again, fairy
snow-peaks, showing like dabs of Chinese white against
the cloudless glory of the sky.  It was a day to live
and be thankful for life; a day for deep breath and
noble thoughts, a day to take one's troubles to Nature
and lose them in the splendid silence of her hills and the
vastness of her immaculate snows.
</p>

<p>
The royal party of five shuffled along on their wooden
footgear till they came to a long dip with a gentle rise
at the end of it.  Karl was the first to essay the descent.
With knees slightly bent, one foot slightly in front
of the other, his burly body noticeably inclined
forward, he started on his downward course.  For a second
or two he moved slowly.  Then the pace increased till
he was travelling at a sharp speed; then, as the momentum
grew, and the angle of the hillside sharpened, he
fairly flew through the air in the swift, smooth rush
that brings joy to the heart of the ski-runner.  At the
bottom he got into some soft snow, and after a
fruitless struggle with the laws of gravity, the royal
equipoise was overcome, and Karl lay prone and buried
in the gleaming crystals.  A roar of delight burst
from his companions above, and a ski-shod foot was
waved answeringly in the air in plaintive rebuke at
their merriment.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Saunders was the next to come down.  With
perfect balance,&mdash;relying not at all on her guiding
stick,&mdash;she swept down the mountain-side like a
Valkyrie.  With grey eyes shining with pleasure,
wisps of fair hair streaming from under her woollen
beret, she seemed the embodiment of graceful and
athletic young womanhood.  Her course was taking
her direct on to the prostrate monarch, but at the
critical moment she swung round with a superb Telemark
turn, and halted to watch Karl's desperate efforts
to regain an upright position.
</p>

<p>
The others descended in turn with varying elegance
but without serious mishap, Von Hügelweiler bringing
up the rear and nearly injuring his sovereign whom
he had sworn so solemnly to defend.  Onward they
went again, shuffling along levels, gliding down
descents, mounting laboriously sideways, like crabs, when
it was necessary to reach higher ground.  In the
pleasurable absorption of their sport they wandered far,
ever gaining fresh joys of swift descent or harmless
fall, and winning fresh views of plain and wood and
mountain.
</p>

<p>
"There go the Americans," said the King to Mrs. Saunders.
"They have been travelling parallel to us."
</p>

<p>
The King's party had collected under a mutual desire
for rest, by a crop of boulders which broke through
the level surface of the snows.
</p>

<p>
"Parallel to us," agreed Meyer, mopping his humid
face, "but I notice that they always manœuvre for the
upper ground."
</p>

<p>
The King frowned at the General's speech.  He was
enjoying the morning's relaxation from his usual
worries, and Meyer's words,&mdash;if they had any meaning
at all,&mdash;suggested personal danger to himself and his
friends.
</p>

<p>
"They are excellent ski-runners," said Mrs. Saunders,
watching them as they moved rapidly to a point of the
hill above them.
</p>

<p>
But Meyer was whispering something in the King's
ear, and a vague sense of apprehension had taken the
party.
</p>

<p>
Karl nodded, as one convinced against his will, and
spoke briefly to the company.
</p>

<p>
"General Meyer suggests that those people may
not be quite so harmless as they seem," he said.
"Personally, I think he is over-suspicious, but in order to
be on the safe side, I propose doubling back down the
hill, and if they turn, too, and follow us, we will assume
the worst."
</p>

<p>
The others received the statement in silence.
</p>

<p>
The gorgeous splendour of the day and the unmatched
loveliness of the scene seemed to mock the
timidity of the Commander-in-Chief's imaginings.  But
all present were too familiar with Grimland politics to
question the prudence of the King's decision; and with
scarce a backward glance they turned round and
followed General Meyer down the hillside.  Presently they
reached a cliff of brown rock which broke the slope
of the mountain with a precipitous drop of some twenty
feet.  Beneath this and parallel to it Meyer decided
to proceed, till the King called a halt for purposes of
reconnoitering.
</p>

<p>
Far below them lay the valley of the Niederkessel,
and plainly discernible were the tiny houses and toy
churches of the capital.  But above them it was
impossible to see anything except the golden-brown wall
of rock which they were following.
</p>

<p>
As swiftly as the operation permitted, Meyer slipped
off his skis, bidding Von Hügelweiler do the same.
The Captain was then told to stand leaning against
the cliff, whereupon the Commander-in-Chief clambered
bravely on to his shoulders.  Then with an agility
remarkable for his years, he drew himself up to the
ledge of rock from which it was possible to overlook
the top of the cliff.  He gazed for a moment with
peering eyes, the others watching with silent interest.
Then he came down in a flash.  "Skis on again,
Captain," he said, kneeling down and inserting his foot
in the shoe of his own ski.  "We must run for it."
</p>

<p>
"Who are they?" demanded the King.
</p>

<p>
"There are six of them, sire," answered the
Commander-in-Chief, tugging viciously at a refractory
strap.  "They are about five hundred yards up the
hillside, and the man in the beard is Father
Bernhardt!"
</p>

<p>
"Father Bernhardt in the beard!" ejaculated the
others.
</p>

<p>
"In a false beard," affirmed Meyer.  "He has had
a fall, and one side has come unhooked.  It's the
ex-priest, sure enough, and full of vengeance for his last
night's inconvenience.  We'd better move at once."
</p>

<p>
Karl hesitated a moment.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like running away," he said, glancing at
Saunders and Von Hügelweiler.
</p>

<p>
"I do," retorted Meyer, "when it's six to four in
their favour.  Come sire, we shall never get a better
chance than this.  They can't follow us direct, because
of this cliff, and while they are making a detour
we will push on to some spot on the railway, and hold
up a train to take us back to Weidenbruck."
</p>

<p>
"The General's right," said Saunders, seeing the
King hesitate.  "We have a lady with us."
</p>

<p>
"Who is not in the least afraid," added the lady
in question.
</p>

<p>
"That is precisely the trouble," said Saunders.
</p>

<p>
"Forward, sire!" urged Meyer, making a move.
"I will lead the way, and you and Mrs. Saunders will
accompany me.  Von Hügelweiler and Heir Saunders
will bring up the rear."
</p>

<p>
"The post of honour!" commented the King.
</p>

<p>
"If you will," said Meyer with a shrug.  "I go first
because I know the countryside.  I am more useful so.
Saunders stays behind because he is the best shot."
</p>

<p>
"A gallant fellow, our Commander-in-Chief,"
sneered Von Hügelweiler to Saunders, as the three
others glided rapidly away down the snow-slope.  The
crack of a rifle punctuated the Captain's remark.
Saunders waited to make sure that neither his wife nor
her escort was touched, and then produced a revolver.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad Meyer has gone on with them," he said.
"He is a clever old fox, and he knows every cliff and
cranny in the countryside."
</p>

<p>
Another shot rang out, but this too failed to take
effect, and in a twinkling the fugitives had disappeared
into the friendly shelter of a pine wood.
</p>

<p>
Saunders wore a pensive air, in marked contrast
to Von Hügelweiler, who was betraying signs of strong
excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Of what are you thinking?" demanded the latter.
</p>

<p>
"I am thinking that if we follow the others we
shall most certainly be shot," replied Saunders.
</p>

<p>
"That is true," agreed the Captain.  "Our enemies
must be quite close now.  It would be madness to
venture out into the open."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely," said Saunders.  "We are left here
as a rear-guard, and it is our duty to check the
pursuit, not to be killed.  Here we are under cover, and
here I propose to remain."
</p>

<p>
"The enemy will make a detour to avoid this cliff,"
said Von Hügelweiler, "then will come our opportunity
to move out."
</p>

<p>
Saunders shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"This cliff stretches half a mile at least, in either
direction," he said, "and there is broken ground
beyond that.  No, they won't make a detour, not if
they're the good ski-runners I take them for.  To a
clever <i>ski-laufer</i>, a jump over a cliff like this is no
very desperate affair, and it's their only chance of
nabbing Karl before he gets back to Weidenbruck."
</p>

<p>
"Then we wait here and fire at them from behind?"
demanded the Captain excitedly, taking his orders from
the distinguished Englishman as a matter of course.
</p>

<p>
"We pot them as they come over&mdash;like pheasants,"
said Saunders.
</p>

<p>
There was a smile on his face, not at the prospect
of taking human life, still less at the chance of losing
his own; for Saunders was not one to welcome danger
for its own sake, though he could always meet it with
coolness and resource.  He was thinking, just then,
of Trafford, and how willingly his excitable friend
would have changed places with them, how jealous and
annoyed he would be at learning that he, Saunders,
had again the luck to be in the thick of a desperate
affair.  Von Hügelweiler noted the smile with admiration.
Saunders was one who had a big hold on the
popular imagination of Grimland, and the Captain
was proud to be associated with him in an enterprise
of this sort.  His divided loyalty to the King and
Princess was quite forgotten in the exigencies of the
situation.  He had a plain duty to perform,&mdash;and he
hoped to perform it creditably in the eyes of the cool,
smiling Englishman who had won such fame in the
stirring winter of 1904.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there was a slight scuffling sound in the
snow above, and a second later something dark came
over their heads like an enormous bird.  It was one
of their pursuers, a braced, rigid figure travelling
through the air with the grace and poise of a skilled
ski-juniper.  Saunders raised a steady hand and fired.
Simultaneously the human projectile collapsed into a
limp and shapeless mass and fell with a dead plump
into a cloud of snow.  A second later and another
ski-jumper had darkened the heavens above them.  He
had heard the crack and seen his comrade fall, but it
was too late to stop his progress.  He turned a
swarthy face with black eyes full of terror, and again
Saunders' revolver spoke, and with a dull groan the
man fell spread-eagled in the snow within a yard of his
companion.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!  Englander," muttered Von Hügelweiler,
his eyes bright with excitement, his fingers nervously
clutching the butt of his own weapon.
</p>

<p>
But Saunders' eyes were cast upwards at the jagged
edge of the cliff above their heads.  After a wait of
some moments the face of a man peered over the
skyline.  Instantaneously Saunders covered it with his
revolver.  But the face remained, and a voice&mdash;the
voice of Father Bernhardt&mdash;spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Don't fire, Herr Saunders!"
</p>

<p>
Saunders remained fixed and tranquil as a statue.
</p>

<p>
"You have killed two of my men, Englishman," went
on the ex-priest.
</p>

<p>
"I think not," returned Saunders calmly.  "The
second man was only wounded in the thigh."
</p>

<p>
"I should be justified in taking your life for this,"
continued Father Bernhardt.
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly," agreed Saunders with composure, "but
you will find the proceeding difficult and rather
dangerous."
</p>

<p>
A low laugh followed Saunders' words.
</p>

<p>
"That's the spirit I admire!" cried the outlaw.
"There's a dash of the devil about that&mdash;and the
devil, you know, is a particular friend of mine."
</p>

<p>
"So I have been led to understand," said Saunders
drily.
</p>

<p>
Again the outlaw laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Come," he said, "will you make a truce with us?
We could probably kill you and your friend there,
but we should lose a man or two in the killing.  Make
truce, and we give you a free return to Weidenbruck,
or wherever you choose to go.  Your friend Karl has
got away safely now,&mdash;thanks to your infernal
coolness,&mdash;so you can make peace with honour."
</p>

<p>
Saunders shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"If my friend, Captain von Hügelweiler, agrees,"
he said, "I consent.  Only there must be no further
pursuit of us or the royal party."
</p>

<p>
"I give my word," said Bernhardt.
</p>

<p>
"Can we trust it?" whispered Von Hügelweiler.
But the ex-priest overheard, and for answer clambered
down the cliff beside them.
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler was no coward, but something
made him give ground before the strange individual
who confronted him.  A man of medium height and
compact build, there was a suggestion of great
muscularity about the outlaw's person.  But it was the
face rather than the body which compelled attention.
The clean-carved, aquiline features, the black, bushy
eyebrows, the piercing eyes, and the strange, restless
light that played in them, made up a personality that
set the turbulent rebel as a man apart from his fellows.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then," he said, thrusting his face into Von
Hügelweiler's, "shoot me, and earn the eternal
gratitude of your sovereign."
</p>

<p>
Again the Captain gave ground, though his timidity
shamed and irritated him.
</p>

<p>
"I am not a murderer," he said, flushing.  "You
come to parley, I imagine."
</p>

<p>
"I come to shake Saunders by the hand," said the
outlaw, turning and stretching out a sudden hand to
the Englishman.  "He is a man, a stubborn fellow,
with a brain of ice and nerves of tested steel.  I would
sooner have him on my side than a pack of artillery
and the whole brigade of Guards."
</p>

<p>
"You flatter me," said Saunders, taking the
proffered hand.  "I am a man of peace."
</p>

<p>
"How lovely are the feet of them that bring us
good tidings of peace," said the outlaw with a scornful
laugh.  "Behold Satan also can quote the Scriptures!
When I sold my soul three years ago to the Father
of Lies I drove a fine bargain.  I took a Queen to
wife&mdash;such a Queen, such a wife!  And my good friends
Ahriman, the Prince of Darkness, and Archmedai, the
Demon of Lust, have given me strength and health
and cunning beyond my fellows, so that no man can
bind me or prevail against me.  They never leave me
long, these good fiends.  It was one of them who
warned me not to lead the pursuit of Karl over this bit
of cliff."
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweller shuddered, but Saunders looked the
outlaw steadily in the face.
</p>

<p>
"Your nerves are out of gear, Bernhardt," he said.
"Did you ever try bromide?"
</p>

<p>
"I've tried asceticism and I've tried debauchery,"
was the leering answer, "and they both vouchsafe
visions of the evil one.  When I was a priest I lived as
a priest: I scourged myself and fasted; but the Prince
of Power of the Air was never far from me.  And now
that I am of the world, worldly, a sinner of strange
sins, a blasphemer, and a wine-bibber, Diabolus and his
satellites are in even more constant attendance on me.
Perhaps I am mad, or perhaps they are there for such
as me to see."
</p>

<p>
"I'd chance the former alternative and see a brain
specialist," suggested Saunders.  "It might save a
deal of wasted blood and treasure to Grimland."
</p>

<p>
"There is no healing for a damned soul," said Bernhardt
fiercely.  "I saw strange things before I drank
the libidinous cup of Tobit.  I see them now.  Saint or
sinner, my eyes have been opened to the unclean hosts
of Beelzebub."
</p>

<p>
Saunders offered the unhappy man a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"Saints and sinners generally do see things," he
said dispassionately.  "I am neither, and my vision
is normal.  If you would live a reasonable life for six
months you might become a useful member of society
instead of a devil-ridden firebrand.  Fasting is bad
and excess is bad.  One starves the brain, the other
gluts it.  Both lead to hallucinations.  Take hold of
life with both hands and be a man with normal appetites
and reasonable relaxations, and you will have men
and women for friends, not the unclean spawn of
over-stimulated brain-cells."
</p>

<p>
A puzzled look crept into Father Bernhardt's eyes.
Then he shook his head firmly.
</p>

<p>
"I won't talk to you any more," he cried angrily.
"I hate talking to you.  I hate your cursed English
common sense.  If I saw much of you I'd lose all the
savour of life.  I'd be a decent, law-abiding citizen,
and miss all the thrills and torments of a man
fire-doomed."
</p>

<p>
"A good conscience is not a bad thing," said Saunders,
"and a man at peace with himself is king of a
fine country.  You're a youngish man, Bernhardt, and
the world's before you.  Give up listening to devils,
and the devils will give up talking to you.  Go on
listening to them and the fine balances of sanity will
be overthrown for ever."
</p>

<p>
"Silence!" cried the ex-priest, thrusting his fingers
in his ears.  "Would you rob me even of my remaining
joys?  For such as me there is no peace.  I have
my mission, and by the devil's aid I must perform it!"
</p>

<p>
"We all have missions," retorted Saunders.  "Mine
apparently is to preserve Karl from assassination.  I
don't boast a body-guard of demons, but I'll back my
luck against yours, Father Bernhardt."
</p>

<p>
The outlaw smiled again at these words.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Englishman," he said, "I love you for
your courage.  Go in peace," he went on, shaking
him by the hand, but ignoring Von Hügelweiler
altogether.  "But take heed to yourself, for you are
pitting yourself against a man who is neither wholly
sane nor wholly mad, and therefore entirely to be
feared.  Good-bye, and tell the Jew Meyer that
to-night I am dwelling in the Goose-market, at the house
of Fritz Birnbaum, the cobbler.  Let him send to take
me and see whether he is stronger than my dear allies,
Archmedai and Ahriman."
</p>

<p>
"I will make a point of doing so," said Saunders,
preparing to depart, "and I will lay a shade of odds
on the Jew."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER ELEVEN
<br><br>
THE IRON MAIDEN
</h3>

<p>
While the Englishman was ski-running and saving the
King's life, the American had spent an uneventful
morning seeing the sights of the capital.  Acting on
his friend's advice he had visited the Reichs Museum,
wherein were housed some extremely old Masters, some
indifferent modern sculpture, and a wholly admirable
collection of engravings by Albrecht Dürer.  But
Trafford's mind had wandered from pre-Raphaelite
anatomy and marble modernities to a pair of dark
eyes, a finely chiselled little nose, and a diminutive
mouth, that were utterly unlike anything depicted by
Botticelli, Fra Angelo, or the great Bavarian engraver.
</p>

<p>
Art had never held an important place in his mind,
and on this fine January morning it competed feebly
with a certain restless longing that had stolen over his
ill-balanced nervous system, to the domination of his
thoughts and the destruction of his critical faculties.
He desired to be out in the open air, and he desired to
see, and touch, and speak with a certain young woman
who had passed herself off as his sister at his hotel,
but who had disappeared into thin air long before he
had tasted his <i>petit déjeuner</i> of coffee and rolls.  It
was not, he told himself, that he was in love.  Love,&mdash;as
he conceived it,&mdash;was something akin to worship,
a regard pure as the snows, passionless almost in its
humility and reverence.  For one woman he had felt
that marvellous adoration; he would never feel it again
for any woman in the world.  But beauty appeals
even to those who have suffered at beauty's hands, and
the Princess Gloria was a maiden of such bewildering
moods, so compounded of laughter and fierceness, of
such human pathos and relentless purpose, that she
was bound to have a disturbing effect on so responsive
and sensitive a soul as his.  He acknowledged the
obsession, for it was patent and paramount.  But he
told himself that in his regard there were no deeps,
certainly no worship; merely a desire to cultivate an
attractive young woman whose habitual behaviour was
as heedless of the conventions as his own.
</p>

<p>
But this desire took him out of the long galleries
of the Reichs Museum into the slums of Weidenbruck,
into the purlieus of the Goose-market and the
Grassmarket, and into the network of narrow alleys round
about the Schugasse.  But the face and figure that
were in his mind's eye refused to grace his bodily sight,
and so,&mdash;having lost himself half a dozen times and
gained a magnificent appetite,&mdash;he took a sleigh and
drove back to the Hôtel Concordia.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of his meal Saunders arrived, and told
him at full length of his morning's adventures.  And,
as Saunders had expected, Trafford's disappointment
at having missed the exhilarating rencontre with Father
Bernhardt was palpable and forcibly expressed.
</p>

<p>
"Confound your beastly luck!" he said.  "And, I
suppose,&mdash;thanks to your brilliant shooting, and
tactful diplomacy,&mdash;the King got away."
</p>

<p>
"He got home safely with my wife and General
Meyer three-quarters of an hour before I did,"
replied Saunders, ignoring the sarcasm.  "They held
up a train on the big stone viaduct, and I and Von
Hügelweiler tapped one at a small station called
Henduck.  It is a pity you were not with us, Nervy."
</p>

<p>
Trafford ground his teeth.  His companion was very
irritating.
</p>

<p>
"What about this afternoon?" he asked despairingly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid there won't be any excitements this
afternoon," replied Saunders blandly.  "I've got to
accompany Karl to a bazaar in aid of distressed
gentle-women.  As you are dining to-night at the palace, we
shall, of course, meet.  Au revoir till then.  You might
well have another look at those Dürers."
</p>

<p>
"D&mdash;&mdash; the Dürers!" said Trafford angrily, as his
friend left the dining-room.  "And hang Saunders for
a selfish brute!" he added to himself.  "He lures me
out to this infernal country, and then sends me to
picture galleries and museums while he shoots people
ski-jumping over his head."  And with the air of an
aggrieved man Trafford kindled an enormous cigar
and sauntered forth into the hall.
</p>

<p>
As he did so, he was approached by the concierge.
</p>

<p>
"A letter, mein Herr," said the official: "a
messenger left it a moment ago."
</p>

<p>
Trafford took it, and as he read his eyes opened in
astonishment, and his mouth in satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Dear Herr Trafford</i>," it ran.  "<i>This is to thank
you for what you did for me last night.  You fight as
well as you skate&mdash;and that is saying much.  If you
will meet me at the Collection of Instruments of Torture
in the Strafeburg at three o'clock this afternoon,
I shall try to be as fascinating as you could wish
me&mdash;and take back any unkind word I may have spoken.</i>"
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>G.V.S.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Trafford chuckled to himself.  After all, he
reflected, Saunders was not having all the fun.  He had
not mentioned his adventures of the previous evening
to his friend, because he knew that Saunders would
disapprove of his action in abetting Karl's enemies.
He, however, was a free lance, and if he was not
permitted to save the King's life, he might as well devote
his energies to the equally romantic task of protecting
the rebel Princess.  And in his rapture at the unfolding
prospect of unlimited fracas, he chuckled audibly.
</p>

<p>
Then, turning somewhat abruptly, he bumped into
a gentleman, who must have been standing extremely
close behind him.  Instinctively he thrust his letter
into his pocket, realising that the missive was not
merely a private but a secret one.  He half-feared
that the person into whom he had cannoned,&mdash;and
whose approach he ought to have heard on the
marble-paved hall,&mdash;might have been covertly reading his
letter over his shoulder; nor was he particularly
reassured at finding that the individual in question was
none other than General Meyer.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," began the Commander-in-Chief,
"but I was not quite sure that it was you, as I
could not see your face while you were reading your
letter."
</p>

<p>
"My fault entirely," said Trafford genially.
"Were you looking for me?"
</p>

<p>
"I was.  I came to say that the command which his
Majesty graciously issued to you to dine with him
to-night is also extended to your sister."
</p>

<p>
"My sister!" repeated Trafford, in dazed accents.
</p>

<p>
Meyer smiled at the other's mystification.  "I was
informed at the bureau that your sister was staying
at the hotel with you," he said blandly.
</p>

<p>
Instantly the fraud of the previous evening returned
to Trafford's memory.
</p>

<p>
"She spent last night at the hotel," he said, "but
she left early this morning."
</p>

<p>
"A brief visit!" was the General's comment.
</p>

<p>
"Extremely!  She is on her way to Vienna.  She&mdash;she
took the opportunity of paying me a flying visit
to see me compete for the King's Cup on the Rundsee.
She went on by the 8:35 this morning."
</p>

<p>
Meyer nodded, as if appreciating the other's
glibness.
</p>

<p>
"Would you think me very inquisitive," he went
on, "if I asked at what hotel she will be staying in
Vienna?"
</p>

<p>
"She is not going to a hotel," replied Trafford.
"She is going to stay with my aunt,&mdash;my dear Aunt
Martha,&mdash;whose address I cannot for a moment recall.
I shall doubtless hear from her in a day or so, when I
will communicate her whereabouts to you&mdash;if you
particularly desire it."
</p>

<p>
"Please do not trouble," said the General, scrutinising
his companion closely through his eye-glass.  "But
there is one further question I would put to you.  How
is it that Saunders does not even know that you have a
sister?"  Meyer's tones were of the blandest, but there
was something in his look and bearing that bespoke
suspicions that had become certainties.  Trafford read
danger in the mocking voice and smiling lips, and he
grew wonderfully cool.
</p>

<p>
"That's dead easy!&mdash;she's only my half-sister," he
replied.  "We see little of each other.  Saunders
may well have never chanced to meet her or even hear
of her.  My half-sister, you know, detests men.  In
fact, my only fear of her going to Vienna is lest she
should at once enter a nunnery and never be seen
again."
</p>

<p>
Meyer dropped his eye-glass in a facial convulsion
of admiration.
</p>

<p>
"Au revoir, Herr Trafford!" he said, with a gracious
bow.  "We meet at eight o'clock at the Palace
to-night.  But I am desolated at the idea of not
seeing&mdash;your half-sister."
</p>

<p>
Shortly after the Commander-in-Chief's departure,
Trafford donned his overcoat and sallied forth on foot
to the Strafeburg.  The beauty of the day was gone.
The mist that had been dispelled by the noonday sun
had settled down again on the city.  The penetrating
cold, born of a low temperature and a moisture-laden
atmosphere, nipped and pinched the extremities, and
ate its way behind muscles and joints till Trafford,&mdash;despite
his warm coat,&mdash;was glad enough to reach the
friendly shelter of the ancient prison-house.  A
half-krone procured him admission to the show-rooms of the
famous building, and a young woman, angular of build
and exceptionally tall, took him under her bony wing,
and commenced to show him the objects of interest.
Trafford had come to see something less forbidding
than racks and thumb-screws, but for the moment the
object of his visit being nowhere to be seen, he devoted
a temporary interest to the quaint and sinister-looking
objects displayed on all sides of him.  These,&mdash;as
has already been made clear,&mdash;were mainly the
ingenious contrivements of filthy minds for the infliction
of the utmost possible suffering on human beings.  A
judiciously-displayed assortment of racks, wheels,
water-funnels, and other abominations, soon had the
effect of making Trafford feel physically sick.  Nor
was his horror lessened by the custodian's monotonous
and unemotional recital of the various uses to which the
different pieces of mechanism could be put.  And as
his thoughts travelled back across the centuries to the
time when men did devil's work of maiming and mutilating
what was made in God's own image, a fearful
fascination absorbed the American's mind, so that he
quite forgot the Princess in a sort of frenzy of horror
and wrathful mystification.
</p>

<p>
In the third room they visited,&mdash;a gaunt department
of deeply-recessed windows and heavy cross-beams,&mdash;was
an assortment of especially ferocious contrivements.
</p>

<p>
"This was used for those who made bad money,"
went on the long-limbed maiden, in her droning monotone,
indicating a gigantic press which was capable of
converting the human frame into the semblance of a
pancake.  "The coiner lay down here, and the weights
were put on his chest&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stop! for heaven's sake," ejaculated Trafford,
white with emotion.  "If I could get hold of one of
those mediæval torturers I'd give him a good Yankee
kick to help him realise what pain meant."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure your kick would be a most enthusiastic
one," said a voice at his elbow.  A lady in handsome
furs and a blue veil&mdash;a common protection, in
Grimland, against snow-glare&mdash;was addressing him.
Despite this concealment, however, Trafford did not need
to look twice before recognising the Princess Gloria.
</p>

<p>
"You can leave us, Martha," commanded the Princess
to the angular attendant.  "I am quite capable
of describing these horrors to this gentleman.  I am
sufficiently familiar with the Strafeburg, and shall quite
possibly become more so."  Then, as the obedient
Martha withdrew her many inches from the room:
</p>

<p>
"I want to thank you for last night's work," she
said to Trafford; "and if I may, to ask&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Charmed to have been of service," interrupted the
American, and taking the Princess's hand, he bent low
and kissed it.  As he raised his head again there was
a flush in his cheek and a fire in his eye that seemed
portents of something warmer than the Platonism of a
dead soul.  "But don't resume the hospitality of the
Concordia," he added.  "Meyer suspects, and my lying
capacities have been well-nigh exhausted."
</p>

<p>
"He has been cross-questioning you?"
</p>

<p>
"Most pertinaciously; but I lied with fluency and
fervour."
</p>

<p>
The Princess laughed gaily.
</p>

<p>
"You are splendid!" she cried, clapping her hands
with girlish excitement.  "Do you know," she went on
presently, "that the authorities, acting under Herr
Saunders' advice, are going to adopt strenuous
measures against us?"
</p>

<p>
"Is that anything new?"
</p>

<p>
"Not exactly.  But they have decided to leave off
trying to murder us, and are going to try and take
us openly.  The ex-Queen,&mdash;whose nerves are not very
good,&mdash;has already crossed the frontier into Austria.
Father Bernhardt has found several new hiding-places,
and a brace of new revolvers."
</p>

<p>
"And you?" asked Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"Have found you," she answered with a frank smile.
</p>

<p>
"Admirable!" laughed the American.  "But tell
me, pray, how I can serve you."
</p>

<p>
"You will be dining at the Palace to-night.  Find
out all you can and report to me."
</p>

<p>
Trafford was silent.  He was about to dine with the
King, and he had certain scruples about the sacredness
of hospitality.  Quick as a flash the Princess read
his silence, and bit her lip.
</p>

<p>
"Now then," she said, as if to change the subject,
"let me play the part of showman.  Here we have the
famous 'Iron Maiden.'"
</p>

<p>
Trafford beheld a weird sarcophagus set upright
against the wall, and rudely shaped like a human form.
On the head were painted the lineaments of a woman's
face, and the mediæval craftsman had contrived to
portray a countenance of abominable cruelty, not devoid
of a certain sullen, archaic beauty.  A vertical joint
ran from the crown of the head to the base, and the
thing opened in the middle with twin doors.  The
Princess inserted a heavy key,&mdash;which was hanging from a
convenient nail,&mdash;and displayed the interior.
</p>

<p>
"Now you see the charm of the thing," she went
on, as the inside of the iron doors revealed a number of
ferocious spikes.  "The poor wretch was put inside,
and the doors were slowly shut on him.  See, there is
a spike for each eye, one for each breast, and several
for the legs.  The embrace of the Iron Maiden was not
a thing to be lightly undertaken."
</p>

<p>
"Of all the fiendish, hellish&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It was made by one Otto the Hunchback," pursued
the Princess, "and it was so admired in its day,
that the reigning monarch of Bavaria had a duplicate
made, and it stands in the castle of Nuremberg to this
day."
</p>

<p>
"When was this thing last used?" inquired Trafford
in hoarse tones.
</p>

<p>
"It is said that the late Archbishop of Weidenbruck
was killed in this way, three years ago," replied the
Princess calmly.
</p>

<p>
Trafford was white with indignation.
</p>

<p>
"Who says so?" he demanded fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"Everybody.  The King hated him, and he died of
cancer&mdash;officially.  I was told&mdash;and I honestly
believe&mdash;that he was killed by torture, because when the
troubles of 1904 were at an end, he openly incited the
people to revolt."
</p>

<p>
"If that's true," said Trafford, "I shan't make
much bones about siding with you against Karl XXII.
And it won't worry my conscience reporting to you
anything I may accidentally overhear at the dinner
to-night."
</p>

<p>
"We can't fight in kid gloves," said the Princess
with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
A sudden noise in the street without attracted his
attention.  Light as a bird, the Princess leaped into
the embrasure of the window.  Trafford followed suit.
A company of soldiers was drawn up outside the building,
and facing them was a fair-sized mob jeering and
cheering ironically.  A number of units were detached
under an officer to either side of the building, and it
was plain that the Strafeburg was being surrounded by
the military.  A second later there was the dull sound
of hoofs on snow, and a squadron of cavalry entered
the platz from another direction.  Lined up at right
angles to the Strafeburg, carbine on knee, they held
the threatening mob in hand with the silent menace of
ball and gunpowder.
</p>

<p>
Trafford and the Princess looked at each other in
blank and silent amazement.
</p>

<p>
"This means business," said the latter, pale but
composed.  "The Guides and the King's Dragoons are
not being paraded for nothing.  Royalty is going to
be arrested with the pomp and circumstance due to
the occasion."
</p>

<p>
"They have discovered your presence here?"
</p>

<p>
"Obviously.  I am caught like a rat in a trap."
</p>

<p>
Trafford scanned the bloodless but firm countenance,
and admired intensely.  Here was no hysterical
school-girl playing at high treason for sheer love of
excitement, but a young woman who was very much in
earnest, very much distressed, and at the same time
splendidly self-controlled.  He stood a moment thinking
furiously with knitted brows, hoping that his racing
thoughts might devise some scheme for averting the
impending tragedy.  The room they were in was the
last of a series, and possessed of but one door.  To
return that way was to come back inevitably to the
entrance hall,&mdash;a proceeding which would merely
expedite the intentions of their enemies.  He looked
hopelessly round the chamber, and he dashed across to the
great stone fireplace.  It would have formed an
admirable place of concealment had not its smoke aperture
been barred with a substantial iron grille.
</p>

<p>
"It's no use," sighed the Princess wearily.  "I must
face my fate.  Perhaps the good burghers will effect
a rescue."
</p>

<p>
"Not if the King's Dragoons do their duty,"
retorted Trafford grimly.  "Mob-heroism is not much
use against ball-cartridges."
</p>

<p>
"Then I must yield to the inevitable."
</p>

<p>
Trafford shook his head fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"That is just what you must not do!"  he cried.
For a moment he stood irresolute, running his hand
through his stiff, up-standing hair.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p122"></a>
"I've got some sort of an idea," he said at length.
</p>

<p>
Approaching a table whereon were displayed a number
of torture implements, he selected a pair of gigantic
pinchers that had been specially designed for
tampering with human anatomy, and applied them
vigorusly to the nuts which fixed the spikes of the Iron
Maiden.
</p>

<p>
"Otto the Hunchback little knew that his <i>chef
d'œuvre</i> would be put to such a benevolent purpose
as a refuge," he said, as he loosened and withdrew the
spikes one by one from their rusty environment.
"Given ten minutes' respite, and I'll guarantee a
hiding-place no one in his senses will dream of
searching."
</p>

<p>
"Quick, quick, quick!" cried the Princess in a
crescendo of excitement, transformed again from a pale,
hunted creature to a gleeful schoolgirl playing a
particularly exciting game of hide-and-seek.  "I hear
them searching the other rooms.  Quick!"
</p>

<p>
Trafford deposited the last spike in the pocket of his
overcoat, and motioned to his companion to enter.
When she had done so, he closed the doors, locked
them, and put the key into his pocket with the spikes.
</p>

<p>
"Are you all right?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Quite comfy, thanks," answered a muffled voice.
</p>

<p>
Trafford contemplated the exterior of the Iron
Maiden, and was pleased to note air-holes in the
Maiden's ears.  It had not been the intention of the
mediæval tormentor that his victims should die of
suffocation.
</p>

<p>
A few moments later there was the tread of martial
steps along the passage, and the door was thrown
open.  Trafford buried himself in the contemplation of
a water-funnel that had served to inconvenience human
stomachs with an intolerable amount of fluid.
</p>

<p>
"Herr Trafford once again!"
</p>

<p>
The gentleman addressed looked up and beheld the
grey-coated figure of General Meyer.  Behind him with
drawn swords were two officers of the Guides.
</p>

<p>
"Fancy meeting you again," went on the Commander-in-Chief,
putting his eye-glass to his eye, and
smiling his most innocent smile.
</p>

<p>
"Your presence is really more remarkable than
mine," returned Trafford.  "I am a stranger seeing
the sights of Weidenbruck.  You apparently are here
on sterner business."
</p>

<p>
"I am here to effect an important arrest," drawled
the General.  "But perhaps you can aid us in our
purpose," he went on in his blandest tones.  "Have
you by any possible chance seen a young woman
hereabouts?"
</p>

<p>
"I saw one here only a few minutes back."
</p>

<p>
The General produced a note-book&mdash;the same in
which he had jotted down the marks of the skating
competition.
</p>

<p>
"This is most interesting," he said.  "I need hardly
ask you to be precise in your information, as your
remarks will be taken down verbatim."
</p>

<p>
"I will be accuracy itself," said Trafford with mock
seriousness.
</p>

<p>
"Good!  When did you see this woman?"
</p>

<p>
"About a quarter of an hour ago."
</p>

<p>
"Her name?"
</p>

<p>
"I am ignorant of it."
</p>

<p>
"Her age?"
</p>

<p>
"I am bad at guessing ladies' ages; but I should
say between twenty and thirty."
</p>

<p>
"Dark or fair?"
</p>

<p>
"Dark."
</p>

<p>
"I thought so.  Her height&mdash;approximately?"
</p>

<p>
"Six foot two."
</p>

<p>
Meyer stiffened himself indignantly, and the
eye-glass dropped from his eye.
</p>

<p>
"You are trifling, sir," he said angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I have exaggerated," said Trafford
calmly, "put down six foot one-and-a-half."
</p>

<p>
Meyer darted a sidelong glance at the American,
and scribbled something in his book.
</p>

<p>
"Remember," he said, "that you may be called
upon to substantiate that statement, and that false
information&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He must be referring to Martha," broke in one of
the attendant officers.
</p>

<p>
"Martha!" cried Trafford delightedly.  "Yes, I
believe that was her name.  In return for half a krone
she told me more in five minutes about instruments of
torture than my wildest imagination had conceived
possible."
</p>

<p>
"You have seen no one else?" rapped out the General.
</p>

<p>
"Till you arrived I have not seen a soul."
</p>

<p>
Meyer glanced round the room carefully.  He looked
under the several tables whereon the exhibits were
displayed; he put his head up the great stone fireplace;
his glance swept past the Iron Maiden, but it rested
on it for a fraction of a second only.
</p>

<p>
"She is not here," he announced decisively, "this
gentleman has been speaking the truth."
</p>

<p>
"A foolish habit of mine, but ineradicable,"
murmured Trafford ironically.
</p>

<p>
Meyer readjusted his eye-glass and turned, smiling,
to the American.
</p>

<p>
"You behold in me," he said, "a disappointed man.
For the second time in two days I have blundered.  It
is a coincidence, a strange coincidence.  Also it is
regrettable, for I am rapidly dissipating a hard-earned
reputation for astuteness.  Once again, au revoir, my
dear Herr Trafford!  We shall meet at dinner
to-night, and I hope often.  Gentlemen of the Guides,
<i>vorwarts</i>!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER TWELVE
<br><br>
THE SIMPLE POLICY
</h3>

<p>
The royal palace of Weidenbruck&mdash;the Neptunburg,
as it is called, after a leaden statue of the sea god
which stands in its central courtyard&mdash;is a Renaissance
structure of considerable size and dignity.  Its
main façade,&mdash;a pompous, Palladian affair of superimposed
pilasters, stone vases and floral swags,&mdash;fronts
the Königstrasse, a wide thoroughfare joining the
northern suburbs with the Cathedral Square.  Internally,
there is a fine set of state-rooms, a florid chapel,
and the famous muschel-saal, an apartment decorated
with shells, coral, pieces of amber, marble, and
porphyry, and other semi-precious material.  It was into
this apartment, scintillating with light and colour, that
Trafford found himself ushered on his arrival at the
royal domain.
</p>

<p>
General Meyer, resplendent in a pale blue and silver
uniform and sundry brilliant orders, received him and
presented him to his wife, a handsome lady of
South-American origin and an ultra-Republican love of finery.
Saunders was there, also with his wife, the latter
beautiful and stately as a statue, in an empire gown of
creamy green with red roses at her breast.  There was
an old gentleman with a billowy white moustache, and
a young officer of the Guides.  There were the
diplomatic representatives of France and England, and a
bevy of court ladies with the expensive paraphernalia
of plumes, egrets, and voluminous trains.  The company
was a decorative one, and the setting sumptuous,
only needing the sun of the royal presence to gild the
refined gold of the exhilarating scene.
</p>

<p>
Saunders took an early opportunity of drawing
Trafford apart.
</p>

<p>
"Nervy, my boy," the former began, "the King,
Meyer, and myself have been having a little private
conversation about you."
</p>

<p>
"A most interesting topic, to be sure."
</p>

<p>
"Most.  The conclusion we arrived at was that you
had been making an idiotic ass of yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Details, dear flatterer?" demanded Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"This sister business!" expostulated Saunders.
"Why, everybody knows you arrived at the Hôtel
Concordia by yourself, and without expectation of a
visit from any relative."
</p>

<p>
"Everybody knows it?" queried Trafford blandly.
</p>

<p>
"By everybody, I mean the police, who study most
things, and particularly the visitors' list at the
'Concordia.'  The hall-porter of that excellent hotel is one
of Meyer's most trusted agents, and there is not the
slightest doubt that it was the Princess Gloria who
enjoyed the privilege of claiming you as a brother."
</p>

<p>
"A half-brother," corrected Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"A half-brother, then," growled Saunders.  "Anyhow,
it is established beyond a doubt that you have
helped the Princess by every means in your power."
</p>

<p>
"Then we will admit what is universally known,"
said Trafford coolly.  "Only, I don't agree with your
description of me as an idiotic ass.  I came out here
for excitement, and as you don't seem willing to
provide me with it, I am finding it for myself.  Besides,
the Princess is a splendid little person, and to cultivate
her society is the act not of an ass, but of a philosopher."
</p>

<p>
"That sort of philosophy leads to the Strafeburg,"
retorted Saunders.  "Be warned, old friend.  I know
more about this charming country than you do.  You
have won the King's Prize.  Wrap it in tissue paper
and take it by the midnight express to Vienna.  There
is excellent skating to be had there&mdash;and you may come
across your half-sister."
</p>

<p>
"My dear humourist," said Trafford, smiling and
twirling his moustache.  "I have no further use
for&mdash;half-sisters."
</p>

<p>
Saunders started in amazement, not at the words
themselves, but at their tone, and the twinkle that
accompanied them.
</p>

<p>
"Nervy, Nervy Trafford," he said solemnly.  "Do
you suppose a Schattenberg sets her cap at an
American!  If she wins a throne,&mdash;as she may for all I
know,&mdash;you will be put in a row with other gallant
dupes of her witchery, and you will be allowed to kiss
her hand every first and second Thursdays.  Give it
up, man," went on Saunders more heartily.  "Give up
playing poodle-dog to beauty in distress.  You will
get plenty of scars and very few lumps of sugar.
Moreover, you may take it from me that a sterner
policy of suppression is being pursued.  There are
important arrests impending."
</p>

<p>
"Important arrests!" echoed Trafford, laughing
softly.  "Why, I was the means of spoiling one this
afternoon.  I was in the Strafeburg with the Princess
when Meyer turned up with foot and horse to arrest
the poor child.  Not wishing to witness a pathetic
scene, I unscrewed the spikes of the Iron Maiden, and
popped Gloria von Schattenberg inside the barbarous
contrivance.  Needless to say, no one, not even Meyer,
thought of looking in such an impossible hiding-place.
So you see, my British friend, important arrests
sometimes fail to come off."
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes, but not invariably," said a voice close
by the American's ear.  Trafford shuddered rather than
started, for he recognised the acid tones of General
Meyer, and he was getting used to finding that gentleman
near him when he believed him far away.  But the
words depressed him, nevertheless, for they held a note
of ruthless certainty that smelled of damp walls and
barred windows.  He realised that he had made an
enemy, a personal enemy, who was not likely to respect
the liberty of a young foreigner who baulked his
choicest schemes.
</p>

<p>
"I stepped across the room to warn you of the
King's entrance," went on the General suavely.  "His
Majesty is on the point of entering the chamber."
</p>

<p>
A door was flung open by liveried and powdered
menials.  The company drew itself into two lines, and
between them, smiling, portly, debonnair, walked the
big, half-pathetic, half-humorous figure of the King.
He bowed to right and left, murmuring conventional
terms of greeting to all and sundry.
</p>

<p>
To the American he said:
</p>

<p>
"I congratulate you heartily, Herr Trafford, on
winning my skating prize.  I am a great admirer of
the nation to which you have the privilege to belong."
</p>

<p>
Trafford bowed, and took the King's hand, which
was extended to him.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow," went on the monarch, "I am going
to Weissheim, land of clean snow, bright suns, and
crisp, invigorating air!  Farewell, then, to Weidenbruck,
with its penetrating chilliness, its vile, rheumatic
fogs, and its viler and more deadly intrigues!
Then hurrah for ski and skate and toboggan, and the
good granite curling-stone that sings its way from
crampit to tee over the faultless ice!  What say you,
Saunders?"
</p>

<p>
"I say hurrah for winter sport, your Majesty, and
a curse on fogs, meteorological and political!"
</p>

<p>
Dinner was a meal of splendid dulness.  Excellent
viands, faultless champagne, and a gorgeous display
of plate were not in themselves sufficient to counteract
the atmosphere of well-bred boredom that sat heavy
on the company.  The King made desperate efforts to
sustain his role of exuberant geniality, but his wonted
spirits flagged visibly as the evening wore on, and it
was clear that the events of the morning had left him
depressed and heart-weary.  Saunders, indeed, chatted
volubly to Meyer's better-half, a lady who talked
politics with a reckless freedom that was palliated by
occasional flashes of common sense.  Meyer himself,&mdash;glass
in eye, tasting each dish and sipping each wine
with the slow gusto of the connoisseur,&mdash;maintained an
epigrammatic conversation with Mrs. Saunders, whose
ready tongue had nearly as keen an edge as his own.
But poor Trafford,&mdash;despite a healthy appetite and an
appreciation of his high honour,&mdash;was enjoying himself
but little.  The lady whom he was privileged to sit
next to,&mdash;the Frau Generalin von Bilderbaum, <i>née</i>
Fräulein von Helder, formerly maid of honour to the
ex-Queen,&mdash;was a wife of the General with the snowy
moustache, and her sole topic of conversation was her
husband.  She was a lady of immense proportions and
a more than corresponding appetite, and her devotion
to her spouse would have been more romantic, had she
possessed features as well as contours.  During the
meal Trafford was much enlightened as to the loyal
and devoted career of General von Bilderbaum and the
digestive capacities of an ex-maid of honour.
</p>

<p>
"The General fought with distinction in the trenches
at Offen in '84, and he took part also with great
distinction in the hill fighting round about Kurdeburg in
'86.  In '87&mdash;&mdash;"  Fortunately for Trafford the flow
of the worthy lady's recital was checked.  A menial,
pompous, in plush and yellow braid, put his powdered
head between him and his persecutrix, whispering in
his ear: "His Majesty will take wine with you, sir."
</p>

<p>
Trafford looked up to the end of the table where the
King sat.  King Karl, with raised glass and a resumption of
his genial smile, was endeavouring to catch his eye.
</p>

<p>
Trafford raised his glass and flushed.  It is not
given to every man to be toasted by a reigning
sovereign, and Trafford felt a sense of pride that surged
up in his bosom with no little strength.  Then the
incongruity of his position struck him.  There was he,
eating the King's food, and drinking the King's wine,
and at the same time pledged to help and abet his most
relentless enemy.  Nay, more, he had sworn to abuse
his hospitality that evening by gleaning any facts
which might help the rebellious Princess to continue
free to work out her ambitious and subversive
propaganda.  And now he was signalled out for especial
honour, and he blushed, not because the eyes of the ladies
regarded him with frank admiration, not because Meyer
looked sideways at him with sneering inscrutability, but
because his host, the King, regarded him with a glance
that was all welcome and good fellowship.  And in the
emotion and excitement of the moment Trafford
recalled Saunders' favourable opinion of King Karl,
rather than the Princess Gloria's sinister suggestion of
the torture-chamber.  But just as, with mixed feelings
and mantled cheek, he threw back his head to empty
his glass, a noise from outside attracted his attention.
It was a low, humming noise at first, with sharp notes
rising from its depths.  But it grew louder, and
something in its swelling vibrations checked the glass
untasted in his hand.  Men and women looked at each
other, and the conversation ceased automatically.
Louder the noise grew&mdash;louder, till it was like the
roaring of a great wind or the snarling of innumerable
wild beasts.  And yet, besides its note of wrath and
menace, it held a sub-tone of deep, insistent purpose.
Fair cheeks began to blanch, and an air of pained
expectancy hung heavy on the throng.  For there was
no longer any possibility of mistaking its import.  It
was the hoarse murmur of a mob, wherein the mad
fury of beast and element were blended with human
hatred, and dominated by human intelligence.
</p>

<p>
Meyer sipped his wine composedly, but his face was
a sickly green.  General von Bilderbaum flushed peony,
and Trafford felt big pulses beating in different parts
of his body.  The situation was intolerable in its frozen
anxiety.  With an oath the King rose to his feet,
threw back the great purple curtains that masked the
windows, and flung open the tall casements.  A
redoubled roar of voices flowed in with a stream of icy
air.  The ladies shuddered in their <i>décolleté</i> gowns, but
Trafford,&mdash;heedless alike of frost and etiquette,&mdash;was
on the balcony in an instant by the King's side,
looking down on the great street.  The other men followed
suit immediately, and the sight that met their gaze was
a stirring one.  The broad Königstrasse, which ran
past the palace, was packed with a dense and swaying
throng.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of a bevy of dark-coated police walked
a tall figure, handcuffed, bareheaded, his clothes torn
as if he had been taken with violence, yet retaining
withal an air of fierce scorn and tameless pride.  On
each side of the police tramped companies of infantry
with fixed bayonets.  At the head and at the rear of
the little procession rode formidable detachments of the
King's Dragoons.  And surging behind, menacing,
furious, determined,&mdash;yet held in check by the cold logic
of steel and bullet,&mdash;pressed and swayed and shouted
a great mass of turbulent humanity.
</p>

<p>
"They are arresting Father Bernhardt," drawled
General Meyer, who surveyed the scene through his
eye-glass and with a slight smile.  "This is an
illuminating example of the straightforward policy of
repression."
</p>

<p>
"At any rate, he is being arrested," said the King.
"Under your system he was always on the point of
being arrested.  Once inside the Strafeburg, Father
Bernhardt will not derive much assistance from his
noisy friends out here."
</p>

<p>
"Once inside the Strafeburg&mdash;yes!" sneered Meyer.
"But there is still a quarter of a mile to be traversed;
and unless I mis-read the temper of the good Weidenbruckers,
there will be some sort of attempt at a rescue
in a minute or two."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't they fire on the mob?" spluttered out
General von Bilderbaum, stifling a fine military oath
in his billowy moustache.
</p>

<p>
"Because I ordered the Colonel commanding the
Dragoons not to fire unless a rescue was actually being
attempted," answered Meyer.  "Revolutions are stupid
things, and are best avoided when possible."
</p>

<p>
"I'd fire on the brutes if I were in command,"
murmured the old General with suppressed fierceness, as
the crowd pressed close at the heels of the last file of
Dragoons.
</p>

<p>
Hardly had he spoken when a harsh order rang out
above the growling of the mob, the rear rank swung
their horses round, and with a click of carbines a
volley rang out into the icy air.  A bullet struck the
stonework of the palace, not far from the King's head,
for the soldiers had fired purposely in the air.  Karl
never even winced.  His features wore a look of pained
distress that no personal danger could accentuate.
General Meyer quietly took cover behind a friendly
pilaster, but Trafford,&mdash;wildly excited by the novel
scene,&mdash;watched eagerly the quick panic of the mob.
Helter-skelter they ran, tumbling over each other in
a frenzied effort to avoid the stern reprisal they had
so ruthlessly invited.
</p>

<p>
"A whiff of grape shot!" said Saunders.  "A little
firmness, a little sternness even, and a deal of trouble
is saved.  Another volley in the air, half a dozen
executions, and a few sharp sentences of imprisonment,
and a desperate situation will give way to normal
tranquillity."
</p>

<p>
"I believe you are right," sighed the King.
</p>

<p>
"I don't," said Meyer; and as he spoke the crowd
came back again, surging and rebellious, shouting with
rage and shame and furious determination.
</p>

<p>
"See! a woman is leading them on!" cried the young
officer of the Guides.
</p>

<p>
"So I perceive," said Meyer, turning to Trafford,
who stood next him.  "It is the young lady whose
arrest I strove to bring about this afternoon in the
Strafeburg.  It would perhaps have been better for
her if my purpose had been fulfilled."
</p>

<p>
Trafford drew in his breath and grasped the hand-rail
of the iron balcony with a vise-like grip.
</p>

<p>
"They won't fire on her!" he said in a choked voice.
</p>

<p>
"I think so," said Meyer smoothly.  "A rescue is
certainly being attempted."
</p>

<p>
For a moment it seemed that the torrent of frenzied
humanity would bear down and engulf the thin ranks
of soldiery; but once again the rear rank swung their
horses round, once again there was a precise ripple of
small arms, and once again there was the spluttering
crack of levelled carbines.
</p>

<p>
Trafford, white as a sheet, trembling with suppressed
emotion, shut his eyes.  When he opened them the
compact mass of the crowd had melted into scattered
groups fleeing for dear life in every direction.  Only,
on the trampled snow of the Königstrasse, lay a number
of dark and prostrate objects, some feebly moving,
some stark still.  Trafford turned violently from the
balcony and entered the dining-room with the intention
of making an instant departure.  Wild-eyed, heedless
of good manners, court conventions, or everything
indeed but a dominating desire to break out into the
stricken thoroughfare, he dashed madly through the
great room.  In the doorway a hand, a cool feminine
hand, checked him, and he found himself looking into
the unemotional grey eyes of Mrs. Robert Saunders.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going?" she asked firmly.
</p>

<p>
"Into the street."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Murder has been done.  Someone may need succour."
</p>

<p>
"The wounded will be looked after," said Mrs. Saunders
calmly, "and by more capable hands than
yours.  Your departure now without a formal
leave-taking of his Majesty would produce the worst
impression.  As my husband's friend, your conduct would
reflect on him.  I must ask you to be prudent."
</p>

<p>
Trafford's eyes flamed furiously at the maddening
check.  His whole system was quivering with the
excitement of the situation and the intense desire to find
relief for tortured nerves in vigorous action.  There was
a strange pain, too, in his heart, a queer, stabbing
sensation that he neither analysed nor understood.  All
he knew was that the Palace walls cramped him like a
narrow cell, that he needed air,&mdash;the air of the
Königstrasse.  And yet nothing short of rude violence could
have brushed aside the well-developed young lady who
blocked his exit with such exasperating <i>vis inertiæ</i>.
With a really fine effort of self-control he mastered
himself.
</p>

<p>
"I will be prudent," he said bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you."
</p>

<p>
"It would never do," went on Trafford ironically,
"for your husband to fall out of favour with the
humane King Karl.  He might wake to find himself in
the dungeons of the Strafeburg;" and with a polite
bow he returned through the dining-room to the
balcony.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he asked of Saunders, "does peace reign at
Weidenbruck?"
</p>

<p>
"There seems to be trouble in the direction of the
Grass-market," replied Saunders, pointing to a quarter
from which distant sounds of shouting were faintly
audible.  Almost as he spoke, a red glare lit up the
heavens with a rosy flickering glow.
</p>

<p>
"Incendiarism!" muttered old General Bilderbaum,
feeling instinctively for his sword.
</p>

<p>
The King whispered something in General Meyer's ear.
</p>

<p>
The Commander-in-Chief nodded.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
<br><br>
ON THE WARPATH
</h3>

<p>
While Trafford was devouring the enticing viands of
the Neptunburg, and listening to the inspiriting
conversation of the Frau Generalin von Bilderbaum, a
certain captain in the third regiment of Guides was the
prey to a whole host of mixed sentiments, divergent
ideals, and other troubles of a conscientious egotist.
Ulrich von Hügelweiler was sitting in his barrack
quarters, smoking hard and thinking harder, and
occasionally kicking the legs of the table in an excess of
mental indecision.
</p>

<p>
"I am a loyalist by instinct," he murmured to himself,
lighting his fourteenth cigarette.  "But to whom?
Loyalty is a virtue,&mdash;a grand virtue as a rule,&mdash;but
loyalty to the wrong person is as immoral as worship
paid to a false god."  And having delivered himself of
this platitudinous monologue he kicked another flake of
varnish from the leg of his long-suffering table.
</p>

<p>
He recalled the post of honour that had been
assigned him that morning on the slopes of Nussheim,
and he longed to prove his worth by the solid
arguments of a soldier's sword.  And yet ... and
yet ... it ought to have been he, not the American,
who was the honoured guest at the Neptunburg,
that night.
</p>

<p>
For the memory of his disappointment on the Rundsee
rankled intolerably in his retentive brain.  Meyer
had offered him a dirty task and had cheated him of
fame and glory because he had refused to undertake it.
He hated Meyer&mdash;hated him far more than he loved
the King.  He hated Trafford, too, for winning the
King's Prize.  He threw away his last cigarette-end
with a gesture of annoyance, and rose impatiently to
his feet.  He would have liked at that moment to have
faced Meyer on even terms with measured swords and
stripped body; and having pinked the Jew's bosom,
he would like to do the same service to the cursed
American, who had come between him and his honourable
ambition.  But Karl had played no part, so far as
he knew, in the dishonourable intrigue which had
prevented him being placed first in the skating
competition.  Karl was a man who had proved his personal
courage in the rising of 1904, and who,&mdash;despite the
ugly rumours which flooded the city,&mdash;had an
undoubted charm of personality.  He repented of having
tendered his resignation, for the manner in which that
resignation had been deferred touched all that was
most soldierly and honourable in his heart.  And then
into the troubled whirlpool of his thoughts came a
vision, so calmly dominating, so unconquerably insistent,
so sweetly imperious, that the dictates alike of hate
and loyalty grew faint and indecisive before the splendid
allure seen of his inward eye.  A Princess stood
before him, bright eyes looked pleadingly into his own,
soft hands caressed the lappet of his coat.  A breath
sweeter than the spices of Araby was in his nostrils.
Conscience, maybe, called one way, but something
stronger than conscience called the other.  The call of
the one was clear and loud; but the call of the other
stirred every fibre in his sensuous being.
</p>

<p>
He sat down again in his arm-chair, and buried his
face in his hands, and because his eyes were blinded by
the action, the vision of Gloria's youthful beauty and
smiling lips grew clearer, more tangible, more
seductive.  His mind harked back to the dismal moment
when he was leaving the Rundsee, a defeated,
discredited candidate for the blue ribbon of the skating
world.  The Princess had appeared to him at a moment
when her bright presence had seemed especially
dazzling by contrast with the black thoughts that
filled his brain.  She had appealed to him for assistance,
had promised, or at least hinted at, the great reward
that would bear him rose-crowned to the stars.
That was worth much&mdash;everything perhaps&mdash;even a
soldier's honour.  But would his honour inevitably be
sacrificed by placing his sword at the Princess's
disposal?  He had reasons for being dissatisfied with his
present service, he argued.  Karl&mdash;well, he could not
bring himself to dislike Karl, but he was certainly a
man of whom much ill was spoken.  His Commander-in-Chief,
Meyer, he knew for a scheming and unscrupulous
politician rather than an honest soldier.  And so,
little by little, desire suborned conscience, till he
persuaded himself,&mdash;as self-centred men habitually
do,&mdash;that the path of pleasure was the path of duty.
</p>

<p>
The blare of a bugle broke rudely on his meditations.
Rising and looking out of the window, he saw
his men hurriedly mustering in the barrack-yard.  A
second later his door burst open and his Colonel
entered.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Hügelweiler, proceed instantly with a full
company and fifty rounds of ball-cartridges to the
Domkircheplatz," came the sharp command.  "There
is trouble outside the Strafeburg, and your orders are
to restore tranquillity at all costs."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
When the party at the Neptunburg broke up abruptly,
as it did soon after the glare of incendiarism
had flushed the sky to a threatening crimson, Trafford
paid a hasty leave-taking of his Majesty, and
hastened down the great staircase to the entrance hall.
Here stood Saunders in close consultation with
General Meyer.
</p>

<p>
"Nervy," said the former, "if I were you I should
stay here.  There is no necessity to go, and if you
come up to my room we can watch things comfortably
from my window."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," said Trafford curtly, "I am not fond of
watching things from the window."
</p>

<p>
"You really must not leave us," said the
Commander-in-Chief, with exaggerated politeness.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I must, though," said the American
decisively, buttoning up his coat and putting on his snow
boots over his evening shoes.
</p>

<p>
"We really cannot allow you to depart," persisted
Meyer, walking to the hall-door and ostentatiously
shooting a massive bolt.
</p>

<p>
A gleam lighted in Trafford's eye, but his response
was politeness itself.
</p>

<p>
I must insist on tearing myself away," he retorted.
</p>

<p>
Saunders and Meyer exchanged glances.
</p>

<p>
"Herr Trafford," said the latter, "when I said you
must not go, I meant to couch a command in terms of
courtesy.  The streets of Weidenbruck are in a
dangerous state to-night, and as the person responsible for
the public safety I really cannot sanction your
departure from the Neptunburg."
</p>

<p>
Trafford glanced round him.  On either side were
flunkeys in powdered wigs, knee breeches, and yellow
coats.  Between him and the street he desired to gain
was&mdash;an elderly Jew.
</p>

<p>
"Is your command based solely on a concern for my
personal safety?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Solely," was Meyer's sarcastic reply.
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall disregard it," said Trafford,
producing his gun and flourishing it about in reckless
fashion, "for I am quite capable of protecting
myself, dear General, I assure you."
</p>

<p>
Meyer flinched violently as the muzzle of the deadly
weapon was pointed in all directions, and most
frequently at his own person.  For a half-moment he
hesitated; he had been playing a game of bluff, but he had
not appreciated the bluffing capabilities of his
opponent.  He might call the guard, but he had a
nerve-destroying idea that if he did so the mad American
would have an accident with the revolver and shoot him
through the leg.  His half-moment's hesitation was
fatal to his scheme for retaining Trafford in the
Neptunburg.  The latter brushed past him, threw back the
bolt, and with a "Good-night, Saunders.  Good-night,
General," vanished into the street.
</p>

<p>
Having gained the open, Trafford's first steps were
directed hastily to the scene of the late contest
between the mob and the soldiers.  The roadway was
strangely empty,&mdash;as though some dominant attraction
had lured away all such as could walk or run,&mdash;leaving
only those whom the recent fracas had robbed
of their limbs' use.  It was these latter to whom
Trafford paid instant and anxious attention.  One by one
he bent over the prostrate forms with peering eyes and
a nameless dread in his heart.  There were about a
dozen, some dead, some dying, some merely incapacitated.
</p>

<p>
At the conclusion of his search Trafford heaved a
deep sigh of relief, for they were all men, and what he
had feared had not happened.  Then, just as he was
wondering what he could do to alleviate the sufferings
of the stricken ones, he saw a party of friars,
black-cloaked and hooded, approaching the scene with
charitable intent.  And so, leaving the task of mercy to
better hands than his, he hastened in the direction from
which distant sounds of shouting were audible.  His
ears led him towards the Cathedral Square, and as the
noise of turbulence swelled louder and fiercer, and as
his own sense of relief at the Princess's escape from
danger made itself felt more consciously, a strange
exaltation of the spirit took him.  His heart sang at
the joyous prospect of a disturbance beside which the
finest college row on record would seem a small and
trivial thing.  He quickened his footsteps to a run, for
his nerves were taut and tingling with the shrill joy of
anarchy.  Houses would be burnt instead of furniture,
policemen would be assaulted with genuine ferocity,
instead of the half-humorous roughness of his
undergraduate days.  The war-drum was sounding in his
ears.  The strange brain, that could pity human
suffering with a superhuman sympathy, was kindled with
the wild flames of primitive pugnacity.  The strange
heart, that could conceive an ethereal, passionless
regard for a woman, was a fierce swirl of troubled waters.
</p>

<p>
Trafford, Nervy Trafford, the fire-brand of Caius,
was on the warpath.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
<br><br>
MUSIC AND THE MOB
</h3>

<p>
When Trafford reached the Cathedral Square he
found a vast number of people, a considerable amount
of noise, but nothing very stirring in the way of action.
The military and the mob seemed to be watching one
another in an equipoise of mutual distrust.  The King's
Dragoons,&mdash;who had escorted Father Bernhardt to the
Strafeburg,&mdash;were patrolling a space before the
prison-house, while the portal itself was held by a company
of Guides under Captain von Hügelweiler.  On one
side, indeed, a body of energetic firemen were engaged
in pumping exceedingly cold water on to an ignited
building, but though the crowd jeered and shouted, the
brass-helmets proceeded in their duty, unheeding and
unmolested.  An air of palpable dejection seemed to
oppress the throng, as though they had tried conclusions
with the military and come off second best.  The
situation pleased the American not at all.  His own
enthusiasm was at boiling-point, and it fretted his high
spirit to see a promising revolution fizzling out for want
of leaders and concerted action.  He edged his way
into the outskirts of the crowd, in the dim hope of
meeting some kindred spirit, perhaps, even if fortune
favoured him, of chancing across the Princess.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, for five minutes of Father Bernhardt!" murmured
a mild-looking individual in spectacles,
broadcloth, and a high felt hat.  Trafford turned and
regarded the gentleman who had voiced that spirited
aspiration in such a tone of quiet pathos.  He was a very
large person, eminently respectable in appearance,
and he was seated on a wooden stall intended for the
display of merchandise.
</p>

<p>
"What would Father Bernhardt do?" asked Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"Do!" echoed the other.  "Why he'd turn these
dull logs of people into blazing firebrands in five
minutes."  The tone was one of regret and disappointment,
slightly bitter and distinctly reproachful.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" said Trafford, scenting a character, and
drawing him out.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the other in rising tones, "with a few
of his red-hot sentences fresh from heaven or hell, or
wherever it is he draws his inspirations, he'd light a
flame that would roast Karl and all his pack of venial
favourites and hungry courtesans."
</p>

<p>
Trafford smiled appreciatively.  There were symptoms
of a battle-light in those big, grey eyes, a certain
rude force and stubborn vigour on those heavy,
bovine features.
</p>

<p>
"Father Bernhardt's in the Strafeburg," said the
American.
</p>

<p>
"Alas, yes," admitted the stranger in a voice of
infinite sadness.  "He alone held the threads of
revolution in his hands.  He alone possessed the magic of
command, the subtle influence that turns <i>canaille</i> into
heroes.  Without him we are an army of sheep without
a leader."
</p>

<p>
"Why not attempt a rescue?" suggested Trafford.
</p>

<p>
The other made a gesture of contempt.
</p>

<p>
"Look at us," he said, with a wave of his hand.
"Do we look the sort of people to pull down six-foot
walls in the face of rifle bullets?  We've been peppered
once to-night, and we didn't like it.  Then the firemen
turned their hoses on us, and the cold water was worse
than the hot fire.  Look at my hat!"
</p>

<p>
Trafford regarded the high felt head-covering, and
could not restrain a smile.  Its crown was shiny and
cockled, and its brim limp and dripping.
</p>

<p>
"I'm wet through," went on the stranger pathetically,
"and I'm going home.  I'm a doctor, and if
there's not going to be a revolution, I'm not going to
undermine my constitution watching these cowards do
nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" said Trafford cheerily, "Something
must and will be done.  Why, my good man, I've come
all the way from New York to see a revolution, and do
you suppose I'm going back without seeing one?"
</p>

<p>
"You'd better make a speech," suggested the
stranger sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
"That's not a bad idea," said Trafford, rubbing
his chin thoughtfully, "but I think I've got a better
one."
</p>

<p>
The stranger turned his glance on the American, a
spark of interest in his gloomy eye.
</p>

<p>
"I heard a song the other night at the Eden
Theatre," went on Trafford.  "I think it was called
the 'Rothlied.'  Its effect on the audience was
remarkable.  Old men became boys, women went fighting mad,
and officers in uniforms swore death to all.  <i>If we could
get the 'Rothlied' going we'd have Father Bernhardt
out of the Strafeburg in half an hour.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Young man," said the stranger solemnly, "I'm
not sure you're not a genius."
</p>

<p>
"Neither am I," said Trafford modestly.  "Look
here&mdash;can you sing?"
</p>

<p>
"I have a powerful baritone&mdash;and you?"
</p>

<p>
"Have the voice of a crow," said Trafford.  "Also
I don't know the words, and I'm not very sure of the
tune."
</p>

<p>
The other repeated a few lines in Trafford's ear and
hummed a few bars of the melody.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," said Trafford.  "Now then, as
loud as you can.  One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Tremble tyrants, base and callous,<br>
  Tremble at the people's cry,<br>
  See the flaming star of freedom<br>
  Rise blood-red in the sky."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In a trice the song was taken up by those nearest the
two agitators, and in an incredibly short time the whole
square was resounding with the swinging chorus of the
inflammatory melody.  The thing succeeded beyond all
expectation.  A new temper seemed to come over the
entire throng.  Wet clothes were forgotten in an access
of revolutionary ardour.  Men who had seen red
wounds and staring death forgot the chill remembrance
in the burning music of the "Rothlied."  Louder and
louder it swelled, fiercer grew the gesticulations of the
fermenting mob.  The whole mass swayed and surged
with the leaven of revived fanaticism.
</p>

<p>
"We've got something to work on now," said Trafford
gleefully.  "Give me a pick-a-back, Herr Doctor,
and I'll make a speech."
</p>

<p>
The doctor bent his massive back, and Trafford
climbed up on to the broad shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Into the thick of them, good doctor horse!" he
cried, and the doctor struggled on manfully under his
burden,&mdash;albeit he lost his high felt hat in the press,
and the cold wind chilled the perspiration on his
benevolent brow.  And Trafford addressed the populace
with fervid words and execrable grammar, and for
some inexplicable reason his assurance and manifest
energy won him a ready hearing and savage applause.
</p>

<p>
"Form barricades!" he shouted at the conclusion
of his wild address.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" whispered the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know that there is no such thing as a
revolution without barricades," replied the American,
"they are a necessary part of the game.  Form
barricades, my brothers!" he repeated in louder tones.
</p>

<p>
"With what?" demanded one.
</p>

<p>
"With snow, son of a crossing-sweeper!" replied
Trafford.  "Work hard, brothers, and form a rampart
breast high, and hold it against all comers."
</p>

<p>
The tone of command and his imposing position on
the big doctor's shoulders, won their way.  The
doctor, too, was recognised as a prominent burgher of
"advanced" tendencies, and the crowd set to work
with the utmost energy and determination.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth are you doing?" asked a soft
voice by his side.
</p>

<p>
Looking down he perceived the Princess Gloria.
The girl was evidently under the stress of great
excitement; her eyes were unnaturally bright and her bosom
was heaving tumultuously under her coat of sables.
But when her eyes met Trafford's she laughed; it would
not have been the Princess Gloria had she not done so.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth are you doing on Doctor Matti's
shoulders?" she repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Telling the people to make snow-men for the
Dragoons to charge against," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"But that won't stop them," she objected.
</p>

<p>
"Of course it won't," he agreed, "but it keeps these
fellows warm and busy.  The essence of a revolution
is to keep things moving.  Inaction is the foe to
insurrection."
</p>

<p>
"You talk like a paid agitator," she said, still
smiling.
</p>

<p>
"I am.  The highest-paid agitator that ever was.
Have you forgotten the agreed price?"
</p>

<p>
"It will never be earned," said the Princess in a low
voice.  "Our plans are ruined.  Father Bernhardt has
been taken, and without him our organisation crumbles
to pieces."
</p>

<p>
"Nil desperandum Tenero duce et auspice Tenero,"
quoted Trafford softly.  "Substitute Trafford for
Tenero, and hope is unvanquished."
</p>

<p>
"You are going to lead us?" asked the Princess,
with a note of expectant confidence that ministered
strangely to Trafford's pride.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," he replied, "but we want a little more
enthusiasm."
</p>

<p>
"But the people are frantic," objected the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"I was referring to the soldiers," explained Trafford
drily.  "They lack enthusiasm for the popular
cause."
</p>

<p>
"They are our enemies," said the Princess bitterly;
"they have fired on us several times to-night."
</p>

<p>
"They are Grimlanders," retorted Trafford, "and
they only want a slight excuse to forget discipline,
and remember their national characteristics."
</p>

<p>
"I think we shall do well to trust the gentleman on
my shoulders," advised Doctor Matti.  "It was he
who set the 'Rothlied' going, and put fresh courage
into the hearts of the people.  I believe he possesses a
most magnetic personality."
</p>

<p>
"So do I," agreed the Princess heartily.  "Ten
minutes ago all was despondency and depression.
From the time the prison doors were shut on Father
Bernhardt all energy and enthusiasm seemed to die.
No one appeared to know me.  I could not make myself
heard.  I was lost in a mob of my own partisans.  Now
the whole throng is in motion.  Pressure is put on the
soldiers at every point.  If this gentleman were to lead
a charge all might be won."
</p>

<p>
Trafford laughed recklessly.  The situation was
mending with extraordinary rapidity.  There was talk
now of charges, instead of returning home, and the
touching confidence of the Princess in his generalship
put the coping stone on his exhilaration.
</p>

<p>
"Will you do exactly what I tell you?" he asked of
the Princess.
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely," was the sweet reply.
</p>

<p>
"If the people don't recognise you as the Princess,"
he went on, "they must recognise you as the Schöne
Fräulein Schmitt, of the Eden Theatre.  From my
point of vantage on this good gentleman's shoulders
I see a sleigh not far from us, with a couple of horses,
blocked in the crowd.  Let us annex it in the name of
beautiful Miss Smith."
</p>

<p>
At Trafford's command the doctor bore him through
the surging, singing press towards the sleigh, the
Princess following closely in their wake.  It was a public
vehicle of the cab type, and the driver stood at the
horse's head, wondering resignedly when it would be
possible to get out of his present impasse.
</p>

<p>
"Hi! coachman," sung out Trafford; "are you engaged?"
</p>

<p>
"Engaged!  Excellency, I've been here three hours
in the midst of these excited gentlemen, and I daren't
move, for the temper of the people is none too pleasant
to risk an accident."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," said Trafford.  "I'll charter
your cab for the evening.  Here's a twenty krone
piece."  So saying, Trafford leaped on the box-seat
and bade Doctor Matti and the Princess enter the
vehicle.  With a crack of the whip, and a cry of "Make
way there for the beautiful Fräulein Schmitt!  Way
for the singer of the 'Rothlied!'" he forced a slow and
dangerous progress through the close-packed multitude.
His objective was the neck of the Königstrasse, and
somehow he arrived there without injuring life or limb.
Between the cordon of infantry and the mob was an
open space, up and down which a number of officers
walked with drawn swords and a palpable air of
nervousness.  The crowd was still singing the incendiary
song, and the rank and file of the soldiers looked
obviously bored with their duties, and longing to join in
the chorus.  Trafford drew up on the verge of the open
space.
</p>

<p>
"Silence, my friends!" he called out to the crowd,
rising to his feet on the box.  "Silence for the <i>Schöne
Fräulein Schmitt</i>, of the Eden Theatre!"
</p>

<p>
The Princess rose at his gesture of command.  Her
face was pale, and her twitching hands betokened
intense nervousness, but there was a twinkle in her eye
that showed that she added humour to the proverbial
courage of her race.  And in the intense silence of
appreciation her sweet young soprano rang out free and
fresh into the cold night air.  Confidence came to her
with each additional line of the song.  The occasion,&mdash;which
had begun by almost overwhelming her,&mdash;served
now but to stimulate her highest powers.  She put fire
into her melody; she added gestures appropriate and
warlike; she became not merely a singer, but Bellona
herself, young and beautiful and ardent.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah for the beautiful Fräulein!  Hurrah for
freedom!" shouted the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"The chorus, now!" yelled Trafford, with a special
appeal to the soldiers; and, as he had anticipated, the
chorus was sung, not by the mob alone, but by the
triple line of infantry holding the neck of the
Königstrasse.  Harsh commands were given by frantic
officers, but to no avail.  The music had got into the
men's blood, and curses and entreaties, blows even,
failed signally to check the tide of revolutionary
song.
</p>

<p>
"Well sung, brothers!" cried out Trafford as the
song died down.  "Three cheers for the beautiful
Fräulein Schmitt!"
</p>

<p>
Three cheers were given by all, and with especial
heartiness by the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
"Now, listen to what I'm going to say," went on
Trafford in stentorian tones.  "The lady who just
sang that song isn't the beautiful Fräulein Schmitt,
for there is no such person.  The beautiful Fräulein
Schmitt is the most noble and high-born Princess
Gloria von Schattenberg, whom you are going to set
on the throne of Grimland.  Behold your Queen who is
to be!"
</p>

<p>
At these words a mighty shout rent the air.  No one
seemed to doubt the truth of the startling <i>dénouement</i>;
the crowd was drunk with its own singing, drunk with
the lust of anarchy, its reasoning faculties dulled in a
wild orgy of rebellion.  The form and features of the
Princess Gloria were practically unknown in Weidenbruck,
but all the Grimlander's innate love of change
had grouped itself beneath the ægis of her name.  For
years she had been the official figure-head of the
revolutionary party.  Wild legends and poetic fantasies had
been woven round her little-known existence.  And now
the present dramatic disclosure of her personality,&mdash;identified
as it was with that of the popular Fräulein
Schmitt, the singer of the all-pervading
"Rothlied,"&mdash;kindled an enthusiasm no bonds could restrain.
</p>

<p>
"Long live the noble and high-born Princess!"
shouted Trafford, but his voice was drowned in the wild
confusion of cries that shook the air like thunder.  The
soldiers broke their ranks and mingled with the crowd;
several of the officers joined the swelling stream of
insurrection; a few,&mdash;neither wholly false nor wholly
brave,&mdash;slunk off down the Königstrasse, pursued by
the jeers of their late subordinates.
</p>

<p>
Trafford, with the instincts of a true leader, struck
hard while the iron glowed.
</p>

<p>
"To the Strafeburg!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"To the Strafeburg!" shouted a hundred responsive
voices.
</p>

<p>
Trafford cracked his whip, and set his horse in
motion towards the prison house.
</p>

<p>
"To the Strafeburg!  Make way there! way for the
Queen!" he cried.  And in a seething unison of struggling
limbs and straining throats, the vast crowd of
men and women, soldiers and civilians, pressed
irresistibly towards the doomed prison house.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER FIFTEEN
<br><br>
THE TEMPTATION OF ULRICH
</h3>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler,&mdash;standing with his paltry hundred
men facing the wild throng,&mdash;wondered what this
new press and surge of human billows might portend.
So far he had done his duty loyally and well: hour after
hour he had stood at his post watching the varying
temper of the people, as it seethed and cooled and then
rose suddenly again to more than boiling heat.  Nor
did this fresh mood of aggression affright him with its
terrifying unanimity and savage outburst of song.  He
was essentially a man of temperament.  Egotist, in
the sense that he valued his own happiness and
well-being above all things, he was no coward.  Egotists,
in fact, seldom are, for their swollen self-esteem cannot
lightly suffer so humiliating a burden as a suspicion
of timidity.  Moreover, he was young and virile, a scion
of a warlike family, and the vibrant roar of a thousand
voices served but to string his nerves to the heroic
pitch.  Had he foreseen the post that was to be
assigned him that evening his dark cheek might have
blanched at the prospect, and his spirit sickened
before the appalling ferocity of the hungering mob.
But the actual situation,&mdash;serious beyond all
expectation,&mdash;found him not merely calm and determined, but
actually desirous of bringing matters to the touch.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the "Rothlied's" wild measure had mounted
his brain and made him drunk with its pulsing beat,
for he almost wished that these wild men and women
who surged towards him so threateningly were his
comrades in some task of note or honour.  Yet, if they
were his foes, he prayed that they would attack at once
and give swift scope to his itching sword-arm.  So,
blade in hand, with bright eye and scornful lip,&mdash;no
mean figure of a soldier in his grey-blue surcoat,&mdash;he
stood at the head of his company before the portals
of the Strafeburg.
</p>

<p>
But his astonishment was great when, with a swaying
of the mob and a louder note of acclaim, the sleigh
driven by Trafford emerged into the open space held
by the patrolling Dragoons.  He failed for the
moment to recognise in the driver his late rival of the
Rundsee, but his eye quickly detected the fur-enveloped
figure of the Princess on the back seat.  For a moment
his heart stood still, for the Dragoons were
galloping up from the right-hand corner of the building,
and he feared that in the shock of the encounter
violence or mischance might lay low the fair creature whom
he loved more than his honour or his King.  But the
temper of the people was not to let their new-found
heroine be seized or trampled on before their eyes, and
a section of the mob, stiffened by the mutinied soldiers,
thrust a stout wedge between the Princess and the
oncoming cavalry.
</p>

<p>
Trafford rose to his feet on the summit of the box.
Quicker of perception than Von Hügelweiler, he
recognised the latter in an instant.
</p>

<p>
"Good-evening, Herr Captain!" he called out
genially; "kindly open the door of the Strafeburg,&mdash;your
Queen desires it."
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler's eyes wore a daze of wonderment.
What on earth was the American doing on the box of
the Princess's sleigh?
</p>

<p>
"Give your men the order to let us pass," went on
Trafford with masterful good humour; "I want to
avoid bloodshed!  The people mean entering the
Strafeburg; they mean rescuing Father Bernhardt!"
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler laughed scornfully, a rising anger
in his heart.  How dared this mad foreigner address
him in such tones of easy condescension, as if he were
a dog to be coaxed aside from a door!  What was he
doing championing the Princess&mdash;<i>his</i> Princess?
</p>

<p>
"You are a very confident fellow, Herr Trafford!"
he called back; "but if you mean forcing this
doorway you must do it by your own valour.  You have no
favourable umpire here, as on the Rundsee."
</p>

<p>
The allusion passed Trafford by.  Nor did he perceive
that he was face to face with an angry and excited man.
</p>

<p>
"Don't waste time, Captain!" he cried.  "You see
these soldiers here fraternising with the crowd?  Ten
minutes ago they were holding the Königstrasse for
Karl.  Do you see those Dragoons over there?  Are
they forcing a bloody way through the throng to effect
our capture?  No; the troopers are laughing with the
crowd; some of them are singing the 'Rothlied'; even
the officers are resigning themselves to the inevitable,
and cheering for the Princess."
</p>

<p>
This was anything but a true description of the real
state of affairs, as Trafford could see from his exalted
position on the box.  To Von Hügelweiler, however,&mdash;who
could see nothing but a confused mass,&mdash;it
sounded probable enough.  In reality, a pretty stern
struggle was going on, the officer commanding the
Dragoons desiring above all things to annex the
person of the Princess, while at the same time unwilling
to embitter the fury of the people by further slaughter.
No firearms were used, but the troopers were employing
the flats of their swords to considerable purpose,
and despite the courage of the people and the support
of the mutineers, the protecting wedge between the
Princess and the cavalry was being appreciably
diminished.  Trafford saw that success must come
quickly or not at all.
</p>

<p>
"Let us pass, Captain," he went on.  "There's been
enough bloodshed to-night.  I don't want to hurt a
good sportsman like yourself."
</p>

<p>
But Captain Von Hügelweiler was in no mood to
yield to an implied threat.
</p>

<p>
"To the devil with your kindness!" he cried wildly,
brandishing his sword with a defiant gesture.  "Drop
words and come to hand-grips, <i>schweinhund</i> of an
American!"
</p>

<p>
These words would doubtless have had their effect
on the excitable Trafford had not the Princess grasped
the vital danger of the moment.  In a twinkling she
had risen to her feet and thrown out her arms
appealingly.
</p>

<p>
"Ulrich," she implored, "I want your help.  The
whole city is on my side; will you alone stand between
me and my ambition?  Help me now, and I can give
you rewards beside which the King's Prize you failed
to win yesterday will seem a trivial and empty honour."
</p>

<p>
"I want no bribes," said the Captain between his
teeth.
</p>

<p>
"I will make you captain of my body-guard," pursued
the Princess in tones of soft entreaty.  "It will
be your sacred duty to guard my person day and
night.  Ulrich, for the sake of the old days at
Weissheim, will you let me pass?"
</p>

<p>
An anarchy of tangled emotions rioted through the
Captain's brain.  He half-closed his eyes, and his
whole form tottered like that of a drunken man.
</p>

<p>
"Ulrich!" breathed the Princess.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's silence, a life-time of twenty
seconds, during which the blood left the Captain's
face and crowded his bursting heart.  Then came the
jangling crash of steel on stone.  Captain Ulrich von
Hügelweiler had thrown his sword on to the steps of
the prison-house.
</p>

<p>
"Soldiers, present arms!" he called out in a hoarse
voice; and between the ranks of saluting infantry the
Princess and her followers passed into the Strafeburg.

<h3>
CHAPTER SIXTEEN
<br><br>
KING AND CANAILLE
</h3>

<p>
"Where is George Trafford?" asked Mrs. Saunders
of her husband.
</p>

<p>
It was just on ten o'clock, ten minutes, in fact, after
Trafford had bluffed an exit from the Neptunburg;
and Mrs. Saunders was sitting in the Rubens room in
the company of Frau von Bilderbaum.  To retire to
bed in the present unsettled state of affairs was
unthinkable, and the two women,&mdash;so unlike in temperament
and feature, yet linked by the subtle bond of
wifehood,&mdash;sat, to their mutual comfort, in the great
state-room opening on to the palace courtyard.
Disturbances were common things at Weidenbruck, but
to-night there was an extra pressure in the atmosphere.
The air was full of fever and unrest, pregnant with
some issue of decisive import.  A dull anxiety was
written on the women's faces; their eyes seemed watching,
their ears expectantly listening for something.
The tension was almost unbearable in its strained
silence, and Mrs. Saunders hailed her husband's
advent with a sigh of relief.
</p>

<p>
"Where is George Trafford?" she asked again.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," replied Saunders, "but he's not
where I intended him to be&mdash;locked in my dressing-room
with a brandy and soda, and a pack of cards to
play patience with."
</p>

<p>
Saunders had entered from the courtyard, though
the chamber possessed two other doors connecting it
with the corridors of the Neptunburg.  The room itself
was of considerable size, rich in works of art,
mellow with abundant candle-light and the numerous gold
frames that housed some choice products of the old
Flemish painters.  The fireplace,&mdash;by which the two
ladies were seated,&mdash;was a much carven affair of
pale-rose marble with blue-purple markings.  The tiles
round the huge grate were of old Persian manufacture,
holding the rich blue and green tints that modern
chemistry strives so unsuccessfully to approximate.
In one corner of the room stood a tall, ornate clock,
presented to a predecessor of Karl's by the Pompadour:
on the mantelpiece reposed a pair of porphyry
vases, the gift of the late Czar.
</p>

<p>
Frau von Bilderbaum was smoking a cigarette in
enormous puffs, her wide nostrils dilating spasmodically
with the emotion that filled her capacious frame.
</p>

<p>
"Then you have no idea where this wretched American
is?" she demanded in thick tones of pent wrathfulness.
</p>

<p>
"Not the faintest," replied Saunders.  "If I
hazarded a guess, I should say in the Strafeburg."
</p>

<p>
"A prisoner?" questioned Mrs. Saunders quickly.
"I hope so."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so, too," said Saunders, "but I have my
doubts; I wish I had never induced the fellow to come
to Grimland&mdash;he is too much in his element.  He is just
the sort of lunatic to appeal to the average
Weidenbrucker.  But talking of lunatics, thank goodness
Father Bernhardt is safe under lock and key at last!"
</p>

<p>
"How do you know?" asked Frau von Bilderbaum.
</p>

<p>
"A telephone message has just come through from
the police-station; it is good news.  With that
devil-ridden priest at large, and Nervy Trafford fooling
about, it's tough work keeping a sane Government on
its legs."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you were not going to let Mr. Trafford
leave the Palace?" interjected Mrs. Saunders.
</p>

<p>
"That was certainly our intention," admitted
Saunders, "but he argued otherwise, his argument
taking the practical form of a six-chambered revolver,
and&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He threatened you?" interrupted Mrs. Saunders
indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"Not me, perhaps; but Meyer certainly by implication.
Anyway, we let him go to his fate.  He will
quite probably be shot heading a charge against the
military.  In anything of a disturbance he sees red,
and his thinking powers come automatically to a
standstill."
</p>

<p>
"I hate this Mr. Trafford!" exclaimed Frau von
Bilderbaum in harsh, guttural tones, and puffing
furiously at her cigarette.  "Why does not he stay in
his own country and wreck that?  I hate him!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't," said Mrs. Saunders quietly; "I rather
like him.  But I wish my husband had knocked him on
the head rather than let him leave the Neptunburg."
</p>

<p>
At this point the door opened and the King entered,
accompanied by General von Bilderbaum.  The General's
face was scarlet, contrasting effectively with his
snowy hair and moustache and the immaculate
whiteness of his uniform.  His manner,&mdash;like that of his
wife,&mdash;was strongly agitated, and it was evident that
the civic tumult had roused his fighting spirit to a
point dangerously near apoplexy.  The King, in
contrast, looked grey and sad, but his face brightened a
little as the ladies rose at his entrance.
</p>

<p>
"Things seem to be quieting down a little in the
Domkircheplatz," he said.  "I have been talking to
my Prefect Kummer on the telephone, and he thinks
the square will be empty in half an hour."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad," said Mrs. Saunders simply.
</p>

<p>
"I am very glad," echoed Saunders; "I feel some
responsibility in the matter.  It was I who induced
Trafford to come to Weidenbruck.  The fellow was in
trouble, and I wanted to show him sport; but I did not
want him to find his sport at the expense of my
host."
</p>

<p>
Karl laid a kindly hand on Saunders' shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"My very dear friend," he said, "this morning you
saved my life.  About this time three years ago you
saved it under even more dramatic circumstances and
at even greater personal risk.  There is no room for
apologies from you to me."  A silence followed his
Majesty's words.  Then the King went on: "Besides,
this mad American friend of yours is a very small part
of my troubles.  Were my subjects loyal men and true,
his capacity for harm would be nil; as it is, I think we
over-rate it.  With Father Bernhardt in the Strafeburg
we can sleep safe and sound in our beds
to-night."  His Majesty touched the electric bell.  "Let
us drink death to anarchy and revolution," he went on,
as the major-domo Bomcke appeared.  "Bomcke,
brandy and cigarettes, if you please."
</p>

<p>
In a trice the whiskered and stately Bomcke produced
the necessary stimulants from a Buhl cupboard,
and set the shining glass and silver on the great
circular table of Florentine inlay.
</p>

<p>
The men filled their glasses in turn.
</p>

<p>
"Death to anarchy, sire!" cried General von Bilderbaum;
"and may my sword help to deal its death-blow."
</p>

<p>
"Death to traitors, cowards, and&mdash;&mdash;" began
Saunders, but his speech was checked by the
appearance on the scene of General Meyer.
</p>

<p>
"What news?" demanded his Majesty.
</p>

<p>
"Good and bad, sire," replied the Commander-in-Chief.
</p>

<p>
"The good first, please," said Karl.
</p>

<p>
"The Red Hussars have refused to quit their barracks."
</p>

<p>
The King's face fell.
</p>

<p>
"You call that good news?" he said after a pause.
</p>

<p>
"Distinctly," returned Meyer.  "Had they turned
out they would undoubtedly have sided with the rioters.
I know their admirable Colonel, and the <i>ètat d'âme</i> of
his command."
</p>

<p>
The King put his brandy and soda down untasted
on the table.
</p>

<p>
"Now for the bad news," he said firmly.
</p>

<p>
"They are singing the 'Rothlied' in front of the
Strafeburg, sire," was the Commander-in-Chief's reply.
</p>

<p>
"Is that all?" demanded his Majesty.
</p>

<p>
Meyer shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty's subjects are very musical folk,"
he said drily, "and the 'Rothlied' is a very remarkable
melody.  I heard it the other day, and it had almost
the effect of making me feel heroic.  That speaks
volumes for its potency."
</p>

<p>
In the silence which followed these words was heard
the distant tinkling of the telephone bell.  The King
made as though to move towards the door, but changed
his mind and remained where he was, signalling to
Bomcke to take the call.  There were three endless
minutes during which no one spoke; on the faces of all
might be read in contracted brow and half-open mouth,
the sharp dominating expectancy that possessed them,
the sickening fear of ill-tidings, and the struggling
hope of good.  Then the major-domo reappeared, and
the struggling hope was extinguished.  Bomcke's face,
always waxen, was deathly pale, and his suave, smug
pomposity had given way to a palsy of agitation.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" demanded the King; but no answering
speech issued from Bomcke's twitching lips.
</p>

<p>
"Speak, man!" interjected General von Bilderbaum
wrathfully, but the major-domo merely bowed
unctuously and fumbled stupidly with his white hands.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Bomcke?" asked the King, more kindly.
</p>

<p>
"The&mdash;Strafeburg&mdash;&mdash;" said the steward, forming
his words with infinite difficulty.
</p>

<p>
"Go on," said Meyer, almost as bloodless as the
invertebrate major-domo.
</p>

<p>
"The Strafeburg," repeated Bomcke stupidly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, yes!" screamed Frau von Bilderbaum,
losing all patience.  "And what about the Strafeburg?"
</p>

<p>
The question was never answered; perhaps it never
needed an answer, for the stern faces of the King and
his Generals showed that they knew the worst.  But
there was another reason for postponing their
interrogations.  A distant sound of many voices was audible
to the inmates of the Rubens room.  It was a sound
similar to that which had interrupted the dinner-party
at the Neptunburg that evening, a snarling roar of
malice and insensate fury.  Louder it swelled with
amazing rapidity,&mdash;and there was a note of reckless
triumph in its depths that had something very terrible
and disconcerting in it.
</p>

<p>
"Have I your Majesty's permission?" demanded
General von Bilderbaum, drawing his sword and
holding it in stiff salute.
</p>

<p>
"Where is the guard?" asked Karl.
</p>

<p>
"In the courtyard, sire," replied Meyer, "Captain
Traun-Nelidoff is in command."
</p>

<p>
"Have I your Majesty's permission to take over
that command?" persisted Von Bilderbaum.
</p>

<p>
For a moment the King stood motionless in deep
thought.
</p>

<p>
"I will usurp that position myself," he said at
length, going to the door leading on to the courtyard
and flinging it open.  The roar of the shrieking rabble
burst in through the doorway in waves of terrifying
sound.
</p>

<p>
Meyer poured himself out a half-tumblerful of neat
brandy, thought better of it, and handed it to the
collapsing Bomcke.  When he looked up the King had
disappeared into the courtyard, with General von
Bilderbaum and Saunders in his wake.  With a strange
grimace and a muttered "Folly!" he followed, too,
with leaden steps.  For a moment Mrs. Saunders and
Frau von Bilderbaum were left alone.  Their eyes met,
and then their hands.  Both asked a silent question, and
both returned a silent answer.  Then, throwing some
loose wraps around their shoulders, they also went out
to face the grim menace of the night.
</p>

<p>
In the courtyard of the Neptunburg a company of
soldiers was drawn up before the fountain and leaden
statue of the sea-god.  On three sides were stone
façades of pedimented windows and classic pilasters.
On the fourth side, facing the Königstrasse, were
wrought-iron gates between high piers of carved
masonry, bearing electric arc lamps.  Overhead the
stars burned clear in the cold heaven; underfoot was
the trampled carpet of semestral snow.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we fire on the mob, sire?" demanded
Traun-Nelidoff, a tall, lean officer, whose eyes shone as
brightly as his drawn sword.
</p>

<p>
Karl shook his head.  The rabble were pressed
against the iron railings in a frenzy of destructive
lust.  Hands were thrust graspingly between the bars,
curses and jeers issued unceasingly from grinning lips;
the analogy to terriers outside a rat-trap was
irresistible.  But Karl was taking stock of the personnel of
his enemies.  There were low ruffians in abundance,
"hooligans," "apaches," "larrikins" (as they are
called in different cities), "nightwolves," as they were
called in Weidenbruck&mdash;men with the narrow, receding
foreheads that can only house vile thoughts, the ugly,
misshapen mouths that can only utter base words, the
long, loose arms that are more fitted for garotting than
honest work.  Yet there were others: men with hot eyes,
indeed, and upraised voices, but clothed in decent
garments, burghers of some standing in the Stadt, men
with a stake in the country who would not welcome
anarchy for its own wild sake.  There were soldiers,
too, in the throng, and here and there a smart uniform
that bespoke an officer of the line.  Karl watched, and
as he watched the lines deepened on his grey face.
</p>

<p>
"Traun-Nelidoff," he shouted hoarsely, "open the gates!"
</p>

<p>
"We are to charge, sire?" came the breathless inquiry.
</p>

<p>
"No.  These are my people; I wish to speak with them."
</p>

<p>
Traun-Nelidoff protested with a glance, but Karl's
face was set like stone.
</p>

<p>
With slow steps the Captain of the Guard advanced
to the palace gates.  He laid his hand on the huge key,
but it would not budge.  He put the point of his sword
into the iron ring and used it as a lever, and with a
raucous clang the bolt shot back.  There was no need
to do more.  In a twinkling the twin gates were hurled
open by the dense pressure of the closely-packed mob,
and in a few seconds the stately courtyard was a mass
of revolutionaries.
</p>

<p>
The King and his late companions of the Rubensaal
were separated from the Guard by the rush of incomers,
but there was no attack made upon their person.  For
a moment even there was silence; perhaps the
unexpectedness of the situation gave the rebels pause;
perhaps the dignity of the royal presence shamed their
violence.  And, in that silence, Karl stepped forward
as if to speak, but just at that moment there was a
sudden cry of&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Way there! way for the Queen Gloria!" and with
a crack of a whip a sleigh drove through the open
gates into the courtyard.  The driver was George
Trafford!  In the body of the car sat the Princess
Gloria, pale and softly weeping, but struggling bravely
with her tears.  On one side of her was Doctor Matti,
and on the other Father Bernhardt.  But there was
something else in the sleigh, something that was neither
man nor woman, and yet had the lineaments of a human
being.  The Iron Maiden had been taken from the
captured Strafeburg, and was being borne in triumph to
the home of its owner.  Ever since the death of the late
Archbishop,&mdash;and the spreading of the vile legend
which ascribed his sudden demise to the embrace of the
celebrated <i>Eisenmädchen</i>,&mdash;the thing had stood as the
symbol of the cruelty and despotism of the twenty-second
Karl.  So when the tide of revolution had swept
into the ancient prison-house, rude hands had plucked
the maiden from her home, and set her on the sleigh
with the leaders of their emancipation.
</p>

<p>
The sleigh pulled up before the King.
</p>

<p>
"I want to avoid bloodshed," began Trafford in
English, but even as he spoke the mob re-found its old
temper.  Cries and curses ruined all prospect of a
parley; desperate men and wild women pressed in on the
royal party, and clutching hands were thrust even in
the King's face.  This was too much for General von
Bilderbaum.  His hand, which had been itching on his
sword hilt, flashed the weapon from its sheath and
struck down a sallow ruffian who had impinged too
recklessly on the King's person.  In an instant rough
hands were laid on the stout old soldier, and the
General's honourable career looked to be near its certain
termination.  But there was one near him as devoted
to the General as the General was to his Sovereign.
With the quickness of thought Frau von Bilderbaum
hurled her ample person between her husband and his
assailants.  A plump hand was swung, there was a
sounding smack of flesh meeting flesh, and a "night
wolf" was lying prostrate and smarting in the snow.
The sight of the Amazonian fury standing with
dilated nostrils and fiery glance before her lord and
master touched the humour of the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"Well struck, housewife!" shouted one; and for a
moment a burst of laughter took the place of fierce
cries and yells of derision.  But while the incident
was taking place, Trafford had descended from his
box-seat and engaged in conversation with Saunders.  The
latter listened with a grave face, looked doubtful,
and ultimately nodded.  Then, as Trafford remounted
to his seat, Saunders in turn whispered earnestly in
the King's ear.  And almost at once,&mdash;so quick are
the moods of mobs,&mdash;the comic scene was forgotten
and the lust of vengeance came uppermost again in
the minds of the insurgents.
</p>

<p>
"Death to the tyrants!" shouted some.  "Death
to Karl!  Away with oppressors of the people's liberty!"
</p>

<p>
It was a moment of crisis.  Things had reached a
head, and in a minute unless something was done there
would be a hideous massacre.
</p>

<p>
With upraised hands Karl plunged boldly forward
and addressed the crowd.  He spoke, but no word was
audible.  A deafening chorus of jeers and curses stifled
his utterance.  Pale, leonine, unflinching, he faced the
rabid throng.  Then suddenly Trafford and Father
Bernhardt descended from the sleigh.  Between them,
and with the help of Doctor Matti, they dragged the
Iron Maiden out on to the snow of the courtyard.  The
Princess bent forward in an agony of entreaty, but
the ex-priest silenced her with a word.  Then quick as
thought Trafford seized the isolated monarch, pushed
him inside the <i>Eisenmädchen</i>, and with an apparently
great effort shut the doors slowly on his victim.  The
horror took the crowd by surprise.  They had come
lusting for blood but not for torture.  A low intake
of the breath made simultaneously by a hundred
throats gave a vast sibilant sound.  Men looked at
each other in frozen horror.  A woman burst into high
hysterical laughter.  Then with a sudden impulse born
of guilty remorse, the huge concourse began to slink
away from the scene.  At first by twos and threes,
then by tens and twenties, then in one universal
struggling rush.  In a few minutes the only occupants of
the courtyard were the royal party, the guard&mdash;and
the Iron Maiden.
</p>

<p>
"Close the gates, please, Traun-Nelidoff," ordered
Saunders.
</p>

<p>
Mechanically the officer did as he was bid.  General
Meyer was looking at his boots with a vacant stare.
Beads of perspiration were standing on his brow.  Von
Bilderbaum was rubbing snow in an absent-minded way
on his wife's face, the lady having swooned in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"You let him do it&mdash;you let him do it," muttered
Mrs. Saunders reproachfully to her husband.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I let him do it," he answered.  "It was
Trafford's own idea, and shows how near genius lies to
madness.  You see, there were no spikes in the Iron
Maiden; they were all in Trafford's overcoat pocket."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap17"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
<br><br>
"CAPTAIN" TRAFFORD
</h3>

<p>
In his room in the Hôtel Concordia, Nervy Trafford
was standing before a long looking-glass, surveying
his mirrored image with an ever-recurring smile.  Two
days had passed since the Strafeburg had fallen, two
busy days in the nation's history, and this particular
morning found him arrayed in the uniform of a Grimland
Staff-Captain.
</p>

<p>
The dark green tunic with its fur trimming and
black braiding suited his face and figure admirably.
He twirled his moustaches, and disengaged his sword
from between his legs, and his smile broadened to a
laugh.
</p>

<p>
"I only need a false nose," he said to himself, "and
I should make a splendid impersonator of Offenbachian
opera."  And, drawing his sword, he sang with great
spirit and much expression, that inimitable air: "Voici
le sabre de mon pere&mdash;voici le sabre de-e mon pere."
</p>

<p>
A knock at the door checked his vibrato.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Herein!</i>" he called.
</p>

<p>
A boy in a tight brown uniform, adorned with the
usual unnecessary buttons, entered.
</p>

<p>
"A note, Excellency."
</p>

<p>
Trafford took the missive, which bore the royal seal.
It read as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>Neptunburg.</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>My Good Friend,</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>The procession leaves here at mid-day, when you
must be in close attendance on the Royal Person.
Lunch at 2 p.m.  After lunch, an informal Council in
the Throne room.  After the Council, make your way
to the private apartments.  I will give orders for you
to be admitted.</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>Yours very bewildered,</i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>G. v. S., I mean G. R.</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Trafford read, and at the conclusion he whistled.
What did it mean, what could it mean but one thing?
The situation presented itself as a syllogism of amazing
but irrefutable argument.  The Princess was going
to be crowned.  It was undeniable that he had
contributed largely to that consummation.  The corollary
was a ceremony of marriage between himself and the
newly-elected sovereign.  No wonder the smile gave
place to a frown of deep bewilderment.  No wonder
he passed his fingers repeatedly through his thick and
stubborn hair.  The compact that was now disturbing
his peace of mind had been entered into with the lightest
of light hearts.  The night he had first met the Princess
he had been a soldier of fortune primed with good wine
and the spirit of reckless adventure.  But since then
things had progressed with him, as with the state of
Grimland, rapidly.
</p>

<p>
The condition of spiritual stagnation in which he
had visited Grimland was being slowly but surely
overcome by fresh interests and rousing incidents.  Three
days ago it would have seemed a capital jest to go
through the ceremony of marriage with an exceptionally
beautiful girl with a kingdom for her dowry.  Now
it seemed like a piece of wanton blasphemy in the worst
possible taste.
</p>

<p>
He put a cigarette between his lips, and took a
match from a heavy glass bowl that did duty as matchbox.
He struck it on the ribbed side of the bowl, but
the match burned his fingers before even it made
acquaintance with the tobacco.
</p>

<p>
Supposing he went through this ceremony, he
reasoned, and supposing in this topsy-turvy country
the ceremony was approved and ratified by the State&mdash;what
then?  A queer thrill ran through him at the
supposition, but he shook his head fiercely.  The more
he saw of the Princess the more he liked her, and the
more he realised the difference between liking and loving.
There were strange ideals still lurking in the recesses
of his unconventional brain, and to wed a woman for any
less reason than a deep spiritual devotion seemed to
him a prostitution of God's choicest gifts.  And he
could not honestly call his regard for the high-couraged
little Schattenberg a deep spiritual devotion.  It was
clean and healthy as the north wind, and every whit
as wholesome and refreshing&mdash;but was it even approximately
like the sentiment he had entertained for the
pedestalled Angela Knox?
</p>

<p>
He made a second attempt to light his cigarette,
and this time with success.  He blew out a great puff
of blue smoke and gazed earnestly into its unravelling
depths.  And for a prolonged minute of self-hypnotism
he was dematerialised out of the picturesque uniform of
a Grimland officer, and was standing, smug and
frock-coated, in a New York drawing-room.  Before him was
a very tall woman with a wonderfully correct profile
and an abundance of honey-coloured hair.  This was
the creature to whom he had offered the worship of his
life, the woman whose refusal of his suit had thrust
him to the very brink of the grim precipice of which no
man knoweth the bottom.  He gazed and gazed and
even admired&mdash;but he was unmoved.  Slowly the smoke
faded, and the dream in the smoke, and he laughed
aloud.
</p>

<p>
Self-analysis is a difficult game for all, and to one
of his complex temperament an altogether hopeless
proceeding.  And so, as if to blow the crowded thoughts
from his brain, he stepped to his high window overlooking
the city, and flung open the casement.  The
bells of the cathedral were pealing joyous music into the
winter air.  The city was <i>en fête</i>.  The flag of
Grimland was flying from all public and semi-public
buildings.
</p>

<p>
Shops, private houses, and hotels were gay with
bunting and festoons of artificial flowers.  And the
sun,&mdash;as if to honour the new dynasty with its more
than royal majesty,&mdash;was gilding men's handiwork till
tinsel became silver and gold, and every banner a brave
thing of joy and colour and heartfelt holiday.
</p>

<p>
Within two days of the supposed death of Karl
the new dynasty was to be inaugurated with all the
pomp that State and Church could lend the occasion.
</p>

<p>
Things had progressed, not at a run, but at a gallop.
And for this Father Bernhardt was responsible.  The
man was a wonder.  He may have been mad, but if so
his madness was the distortion of a splendid brain, not
the aberration of a weak one.  He had gathered the
reins of government into his own hands with the skill
and confidence of a born ruler.  There was no anarchy,
no confusion, no hiatus in the city's ordering.  Men
were conciliated whom it was wise to conciliate.  Others
were over-awed, a few were suppressed.  He seemed to
know intuitively everyone's sentiments and every man's
abilities.  Doctor Matti was made Prefect of Police,
Von Hügelweiler became Captain of the Guard.  Trafford
was given an official position on the staff of the
Queen's army.  Generally speaking, there was little
redistribution of existing authorities.  The army
welcomed the new <i>régime</i>, believing that a change of
dynasty might involve a change from the peaceful
policy of the twenty-second Karl.  Business men and
professional men accepted it even when they did not
welcome it.  There was no alternative.  Karl, so they
believed, was dead.  His son was far away at
Weissheim, and was far too young a little person to rule
the mad whirlwind of his country's policies.  So the
<i>fait accompli</i> became the thing accepted, and as the
joy bells rang out their message the contagion of their
silver tongues turned the hearts, even of the lukewarm,
to glad allegiance to the young Queen.
</p>

<p>
"Poor little Princess," mused Trafford, as he gazed
out at the sparkling panorama of white roofs and
snow-crested battlements, "what an ordeal lies before you,
to-day and to-morrow, and the day after to-morrow!
It is the day after to-morrow one fears in Grimland.
The sun does not always shine at Weidenbruck, and
the cathedral bells are not always instruments of joy."
</p>

<p>
Another knock at the door interrupted his reverie.
This time it was Von Hügelweiler who responded to his
"<i>herein</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning," said Trafford genially, extending
a hand in greeting.
</p>

<p>
But no answering smile showed on the Captain's
stern and gloomy countenance, and instead of grasping
Trafford's hand, his own went up in a stiff salute.
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler was suffering from Trafford on the
brain.  His natural dislike for the American, born of
the latter's triumph on the Rundsee, had been
extraordinarily deepened by the events of the past few days.
It was Trafford to whom all glory for the capture of
the Strafeburg redounded; Trafford who had set the
"Rothlied" going, suborned the soldiers, "bossed"
everything and everybody as if he were a true born
patriot instead of a foreign adventurer with the devil's
own luck.  Why, next to Father Bernhardt this pig
of an American was the most popular man in Weidenbruck!
All this, in itself, was a source of considerable
annoyance to the sensitive Captain of the Guides; but
what touched him on the raw, was the footing on which
Trafford seemed to stand with the Princess Gloria.  He
knew nothing of the true state of their relations, but
he perceived at once an ease and understanding between
them, which embittered his spirit and spoilt his whole
pleasure in life.  He, Von Hügelweiler, had forfeited
his self-respect, risked all his prospects, his soldier's
honour, for the sake of a half-formulated pledge, for
the vague shadow of a promise of things unutterably
sweet.  Were it to be that this sacrifice had been made
in vain, that this hated American was the one who had
come between him and the heaven of his desire, there
would be a heavy price to be paid, a full price, a
reckoning in something more precious than gold and silver.
And so he had come to Trafford's rooms, not with any
definite idea either of eliciting information or forcing
a quarrel, but because,&mdash;as has been said,&mdash;he had
Trafford on the brain, and he felt it necessary to keep
in touch with him.
</p>

<p>
"To what do I owe the honour of this visit?" the
American went on, getting no response to his greeting.
</p>

<p>
"I come with commands," said the Captain
brusquely.  He was mindful of the <i>de haut en bas</i>
manner which Trafford had employed towards him that
night before the Strafeburg, and he wished to reverse
their respective positions once for all.  "You have been
appointed to the Staff, and I am your superior officer."
</p>

<p>
"Salaam!  Sahib," said Trafford with a facetious bow.
</p>

<p>
Hügelweiler flushed, and went on in angry tones.
</p>

<p>
"My orders are that you start with the royal
procession from the Neptunburg at mid-day.  I, as
Captain of the Guard, shall be in close attendance on the
Queen.  You will bring up the rear with a company
of the Kurdeburg Volunteers."
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler's tone was designedly over-bearing,
but Trafford kept his temper marvellously well, as he
sometimes could, when occasion demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Are those your commands or the Queen's?" he
asked, tossing the glass matchbox a little way into the
air and catching it again.  His behaviour irritated Von
Hügelweiler inexpressibly.
</p>

<p>
"They are commands&mdash;that is enough for you," he
retorted crudely.
</p>

<p>
"Not nearly enough, I assure you," responded
Trafford, with exaggerated blandness.  "I have her
Majesty's orders to be in close attendance on her royal
person.  Until I get counter-orders from an equally
high source I shall perform the pleasant and honourable
duty of being in the closest possible proximity to
our dear Sovereign."
</p>

<p>
Hügelweiler's face became livid with rage.
</p>

<p>
"Show me your orders!" he demanded harshly.
</p>

<p>
"They were conveyed in a private note, otherwise I
should have much pleasure, my superior officer."
</p>

<p>
"I command you to show them to me!" cried the
Captain, losing all patience; "and for heaven's sake
cease tossing that infernal matchbox!"
</p>

<p>
This was altogether too much for Trafford's sorely-tried
self-control.  He had held himself in with incalculable
patience up to now, but he felt that the moment
had arrived for letting himself go&mdash;thoroughly.
</p>

<br>
&quot;If I see so much as an inch of blade this little <br>
hand-grenade of mine will play havoc <br>
with your handsome features&quot;
</p>

<p>
"Von Hügelweiler," he said in peculiarly distinct
tones, "we live in stirring times.  A King has just
lost his throne, a number of high functionaries have
been laid low, a mass of&mdash;shall I say, scum&mdash;has come
to the surface.  No, Captain, don't draw your sword,"
he said sternly, as the Captain flushed crimson and
made a threatening movement with his sword-arm.  "I
am not an unarmed man, my brave officer"&mdash;poising
the substantial matchbox in his right hand, in the
manner of an athlete about to put the weight&mdash;"and
if I see so much as an inch of blade this little
hand-grenade of mine will play havoc with your handsome
features.  That's better," he went on, as the other
shrank back furious but cowed before the strange
missile which threatened his physical attractions,
"that's much better, <i>mon brav</i>.  Curse and swear and
vow vengeance, but don't play any monkey tricks, or
the Guards will want a smarter captain to lead them in
the procession to-day.  And one more word before you
withdraw the sunshine of your presence from the room,"
he continued, as the other made a movement towards
the door with mingled fury and disgust on his
countenance.  "I have taken a hand in the game which is
being played in Grimland.  I have thrown in my lot
with Gloria von Schattenberg, and as her officer I am
prepared to obey as well as command&mdash;in reason.  But
I won't be bullied, Herr Captain.  I'm not built that
way."
</p>

<p>
"You shall answer for your insolence!'" came
viciously through Von Hügelweiler's white teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe, but if you can get the Queen to sanction
my arrest you're a cleverer man than you look, Von
Hügelweiler."
</p>

<p>
A curse hissed from the Captain's lips, and he half
raised his clenched fist in a gesture of intolerable
passion.  Then his arm dropped limp to his side and a
look of suffering came into his eyes, and when he spoke,
it was hoarsely and with a break in his voice.
</p>

<p>
"What is Gloria von Schattenberg to you?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"That is the precise question I was asking myself
when you came in," was the response.  "To answer
it I need solitude, and solitude, Captain,&mdash;as I need
not point out,&mdash;is incompatible with your presence here.
Captain von Hügelweiler, I have the honour of wishing
you good-morning."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
<br><br>
THE FIRST COUNCIL
</h3>

<p>
At noon precisely a cannon was fired from the tower
of the Strafeburg.  Simultaneously the royal procession
started from the Neptunburg, where the Princess
Gloria had taken up her official residence as Sovereign
of Grimland!  It was a brave sight, for the sky was
cloudless and the snow-covered city sparkled into a
myriad smiles under the kiss of the winter sun.  Every
roof wore its gleaming mantle, its shimmering festoons
of stainless crystals; and the countless icicles which
depended from a thousand eaves glistened like huge
diamonds in the vivifying sunlight.
</p>

<p>
First marched the Guards, their band playing the
"Rothlied," which had now become the national anthem.
Then came the Red Hussars with their bright uniforms,
bay chargers, and gaily-pennoned lances.  Then the
Guides on skis&mdash;a popular contingent, judging from
the cheers they drew.  Then the Queen's Bodyguard,
with Von Hügelweiler at their head.  Then the gilt,
lumbering State carriage, with its solitary occupant,
a pale little figure, bowing to right and left, smiling,
nervous, pathetically isolated,&mdash;a pearl in a huge gold
setting.  Next came distinguished personages on
horseback, amongst them Trafford on a great chestnut
charger, and Father Bernhardt in dead black, seated on
a big mare of the same funereal hue.  Then Dragoons,
then Police with Doctor Matti in dark uniform and
cocked hat.  More carriages and powdered coachmen;
more Dragoons, more Guards, Guides, and Grenadiers,
with a strong contingent of Horse Artillery to wind
up with.
</p>

<p>
Nothing was lacking either in the splendour of the
procession or the enthusiasm of the onlookers.
</p>

<p>
Within the cathedral the solemn ceremony of
coronation was conducted by the Archbishop of
Weidenbruck, who maintained the traditional enmity to Karl
exhibited by his predecessor.  And the vast Gothic
building was crowded with nobles and dignitaries, and
a great many others who were very far from being noble
or dignified, but who had been admitted lest the many
absentees should leave conspicuous gaps on the marble
pavement.  For there were many of the older families
of Grimland to whom the events of the last few days
were abhorrent, and who regarded the haste of the
coronation as something shameless and indecent.  Neither,
of course, were there any foreign representatives
present.  Grimland was not a great power, but its
callous condonence of a crime had shocked the moral
sense of Christendom.  But Bernhardt had insisted on
rapidity of action, and for the moment his word was law.
</p>

<p>
After the ceremony came the State luncheon in the
Muschelsaal, an interminable affair of many viands
and divers vintages.  Trafford,&mdash;seated between a
Grafinn of aristocratic lineaments and a deputy's wife
with plebeian features and a shrill scheme of attire,&mdash;ate
little and thought much.  His eyes were constantly
on the white-faced girl who sat on the big gilded chair
at the head of the centre table.  He wondered if he had
ever seen anything so pale and sad in his life.  The
girl who had faced outlawry and risked arrest with a
light heart and laughing lips seemed crushed and
smothered by the pomp and circumstance of her present
dignity.  She talked and smiled and tasted food and
drink, but the Princessin Gloria was dead, and a poor
substitute sat in her gorgeous coronation robes as
Grimland's Queen.
</p>

<p>
In time the long repast came to its end, the guests
departed, and those who were bidden repaired to the
Council in the Throne-room.
</p>

<p>
At this the Queen, Father Bernhardt, Dr. Matti,
Von Hügelweiler, and George Trafford were present.
The captain of the Guides ignored the American with
studied scorn.  The latter responded with an almost
imperceptible but intensely irritating smile.  So far he
had triumphed, for he had occupied a post of great
honour in the procession, and Von Hügelweiler felt his
enemy's insolence like a galling wound.
</p>

<p>
The men in turn proffered formal congratulations to
the freshly-crowned Sovereign.  Gloria thanked them
with a determined effort at graciousness.
</p>

<p>
"Most women, my good friends, have one day in
their lives," she concluded with the ghost of a smile.
"This is mine.  I have had my experience.  I know
what it feels like to drive through a mile and a half
of cheering men and women, to sit in a gilded carriage
with a myriad eyes focussed on my poor, pale face.
I know the solemn moment when the sacred oil is poured
on my hair and the golden rim of sovereignty set on
my brow.  I have dreamed of these things, and the
dream was at least as real as the reality.  It is a
wonderful thing to be a Queen&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But what, madam?" asked Dr. Matti.
</p>

<p>
The big doctor looked rather more ridiculous as
Chief of Police than as a drenched revolutionary in the
Cathedral Square.  He was the only one present who
seemed out of place in the sumptuous Throne-room.
Von Hügelweiler was an aristocrat, and a handsome
one at that.  Bernhardt, despite his wild, black eyes,
was a man of breeding and palpable distinction.
Trafford, with his bold features, fierce moustache, and
picturesque green uniform, might have been a Polish
count of bluest blood and innumerable quarterings.
But Matti, with his big hands, heavy features, and
ungainly figure, was plebeian from the soles of his
enormous feet to the tips of his spatulate fingers.  The
romance of the situation had no appeal for him.  He
served the Queen, not because she was young and
beautiful, but because he honestly believed Karl to have
been a cruel and corrupt monarch, and he hoped for a
regenerate and better ordered State under his
successor.  He represented the prose of the revolution, the
grim sense of duty which often makes revolutionaries
absolutely callous of individual suffering, so long as
their concept of human happiness be furthered.
</p>

<p>
So now he had no sympathy with Gloria's mood of
weakness.
</p>

<p>
"But what, madam?" he repeated.
</p>

<p>
She laughed a little hysterically.
</p>

<p>
"I am not sure it is not better fun to be an exile,"
she sighed.
</p>

<p>
The doctor winced visibly at her words.
</p>

<p>
"Life was not meant for fun," he said irritably.
</p>

<p>
"Mine was, I think," she retorted.  "A certain
gentleman, by name Herr Saunders, told me I should
soon tire of the routine and <i>régime</i> of Queenhood.  I
laughed him to scorn, but I am beginning to think he
knew me better than I knew myself."
</p>

<p>
"Your position has responsibilities as well as
pleasures," pursued the doctor.  "For instance, we shall
have a stern fight to win the recognition of the foreign
powers.  The assassination of poor Karl,&mdash;a brilliant
idea on Herr Trafford's part, and a proceeding of
which I thoroughly approve,&mdash;will take a little
swallowing by the Chanceries of Europe."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Karl!" Gloria murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Moreover," the doctor went on, ignoring the comment,
"the mere fact of coronation,&mdash;important though
it may be,&mdash;is not necessarily a guarantee of unopposed
sovereignty.  We have reports from the north-east
of Grimland that there is considerable dissatisfaction
with the <i>coup d'etat</i> which has just proved fatal
to your Majesty's predecessor.  They say that the
district of Weissheim is in something very like open
revolt."
</p>

<p>
Gloria laughed mirthlessly.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad to hear of it," she said.  "What is the
worth to me of the royalty of men who change their
allegiance as readily as they change their coats?  Karl
was a man.  He had his faults, his crimes, if report
speaks true; but men licked his hand when he was alive,
and I honour them if they fight for his memory when
he is dead."
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!" cried Trafford enthusiastically, and heedless
of the black looks his interjection drew from Von
Hügelweiler and Dr. Matti.  "Bravo!  That's the
spirit I draw my sword for.  I liked what I saw of Karl.
He seemed to me a gentleman, and a good sportsman.
Had I not heard of his cruelty to the late Archbishop,
I don't know that I should have cared to take a hand
against him."
</p>

<p>
"The story of his cruelty to the Archbishop was
a lie," put in Father Bernhardt.  "I ought to know,"
he went on, in answer to the astonished looks of his
hearers, "for I invented it myself.  Karl was a humane
man and a moral man.  Years ago I loved him.
Afterwards I loved his wife,&mdash;and that made a difference."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Matti looked deep disgust.  He was a family
man with strong, not to say Puritan, views on morality.
He knew&mdash;who did not?&mdash;that Bernhardt had eloped
some years ago with Karl's consort, but he had
always imagined the ex-priest to have been actuated by
a disinterested desire to deliver the poor woman from
a brutal and tyrannical husband.  Bernhardt read the
doctor's expression, and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"The devil tempted me,"&mdash;he went on, with a positive
delight in shocking the worthy burgher,&mdash;"and I
fell.  The love I had for Karl turned to hatred.  I
fought against him,&mdash;I lied against him,&mdash;I swore to
effect his downfall, and I effected it; but now that he is
dead I wish to clear his memory.  Karl was never guilty
of inhumanity.  He might be stern when occasion
warranted.  He might be unscrupulous in his methods
of suppressing sedition; he would have been a fool had
he not been so; but he never stooped to torture.  Tell
that abroad, my friends.  Karl was a clean man, a just
man, and if I compassed his ruin it was because that
was the price I paid to Satan for the glories of his
fellowship."
</p>

<p>
All were silent at these words, but Gloria put her
hands before her eyes and shuddered.  Her pallor
became, if possible, intensified.  She appeared tired out,
and as if suffering from a splitting headache.
</p>

<p>
"It seems we have been fighting under false
pretences," she said wearily.
</p>

<p>
It was Von Hügelweiler who answered her.
</p>

<p>
"Karl is dead," he said.  "I sided against him, not
because I hated him, but because I wished to serve the
Princessin Gloria von Schattenberg.  Long live the
Queen!"
</p>

<p>
"Long live the Queen!" echoed Dr. Matti without
enthusiasm.  "If Karl was a good man, he is in heaven.
<i>Requiescat in pace</i>.  We must accept facts, and our
first duty is to pacify the country."
</p>

<p>
"That means an expedition to Weissheim," put in
Father Bernhardt.  "The district is in a ferment.
However, our friends Von Hügelweiler and Herr Trafford,
with a few regiments of sharp-shooters, will put
that right in a few days."
</p>

<p>
"More bloodshed!" sighed Gloria.
</p>

<p>
"The authority of the new Government must be
respected," declared Dr. Matti.  "We must have no
false sentimentality."
</p>

<p>
Gloria rose from her seat with a look of a new-born
resolution on her ashen face.
</p>

<p>
"There must be no more fighting," she said
imperiously.  "I am a Schattenberg, I know, and come
of a race accustomed to hold life as a little thing.  I
plotted against Karl, because my father and brother
met their death at his hands.  But Karl is dead, and his
death is a horrible and ghastly memory to me.  The
men of Weissheim are my subjects, and I will not have
their blood on my hands.  Our Government must be
respected, you say?  We will win respect by mercy
and tolerance, then, not by the cannon and the
shambles!"
</p>

<p>
Dr. Matti's countenance was a picture of
contemptuous irritation.  Bernhardt's head sank on his
breast, as if he were deep in thought.  The silence
was broken by a loud rap at the door.  Von Hügelweiler
strode across the room and opened it.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's whispered consultation.
</p>

<p>
"A messenger with urgent news, your Majesty," said
Hügelweiler at length.
</p>

<p>
"Admit him!"
</p>

<p>
A man in plain clothes entered.  Trafford recognised
him as one of the waiters of the Hôtel Concordia.
</p>

<p>
"Your news, Gottfried, quick," said Bernhardt.
"You are interrupting the Council."
</p>

<p>
The man bowed low to the Queen.
</p>

<p>
"I am head of the Intelligence Department, your
Majesty," he began, "and I have just received news
of such import that I felt it necessary to interrupt your
Majesty's Council in order to impart it."
</p>

<p>
"Proceed," said Gloria with a slight inclination of
her head.
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty, there is much trouble at Weissheim.
The <i>burgherschaft</i> has declared against your
sovereignty.  The troops refuse to take the oath of
allegiance, and the young Prince is cheered wherever
seen."
</p>

<p>
"We know all this," said Bernhardt in some
irritation.
</p>

<p>
"Snow forts are being erected at every strategic
point," the man went on, "and heavy pieces of
ordnance are being put in position."
</p>

<p>
"Naturally," said Bernhardt.  "We did not
imagine they would conduct civil war with popguns."
</p>

<p>
"Is that all?" demanded Von Hügelweiler.
</p>

<p>
"No, excellency.  There is a report,&mdash;a strong
report,&mdash;that the King is not dead; that he escaped with
General Meyer and Herr Saunders, and has made his
way to the Palace of the Brunvarad at Weissheim.
The wires are cut, and the railway has been blown up
in three places, including the great viaduct over the
Niederkessel at Eselbruck.  It is impossible to obtain
direct confirmation, but the rumour is gaining ground
even here that Karl somehow escaped our clutches and
fled to Weissheim."
</p>

<p>
At a sign from Bernhardt the man bowed and withdrew.
</p>

<p>
"A ridiculous rumour, as we have reason to know,"
said Dr. Matti, appealing to the others.
</p>

<p>
"We cannot produce his corpse," said Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Bernhardt; "that was an oversight on
our part.  After consigning Karl to the embrace of
the Iron Maiden we left his body to his friends.  We
should have occupied the Neptunburg there and then,
and drowned old Meyer in the Palace fountain.  As
it was, our consciences got the better of us, we fled
from the scene of our handiwork without completing
our task."
</p>

<p>
"We should never have begun it," cried Gloria.
"I shall never forget the moment when Karl stepped
forth and faced the shrieking rabble.  The man was a
lion among wolves.  What followed will haunt me to
my grave.  And now Father Bernhardt tells us that
Karl was a humane man and a moral man, and that
it is necessary for us to butcher those of his late
subjects who are true to his memory."
</p>

<p>
"We must forget the past and look to the future,"
said Dr. Matti sternly.  "To display weakness now
would only be to increase the sum of human suffering.
This expedition must start at once."
</p>

<p>
The Queen turned in despair to Bernhardt.
</p>

<p>
"You have heard Gottfried's report," said the
ex-priest.  "There must be no delay.  The expedition
must start at once."
</p>

<p>
"The expedition must start at once," echoed Von
Hügelweiler.
</p>

<p>
Gloria turned to Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," said that gentleman absent-mindedly.
"By all means let the expedition start at once.  I will
accompany it."
</p>

<p>
The Queen rose from the throne.
</p>

<p>
"The expedition <i>shall</i> start at once," she said in
tones of unutterable bitterness.  "I command that it
be so.  Gentlemen, I leave you, thanking you for your
loyal counsel.  This is the day of my life, the dreamed-of
day on which I call myself, 'Gloria, Queen of
Grimland.'"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER NINETEEN
<br><br>
THE CHAPEL ROYAL
</h3>

<p>
Nervy Trafford left the Council with the dawning
consciousness that he was not a very wise man.  There
are kings and kings, he reflected, kings to serve, honour
and obey, and kings to harass, embarrass and decapitate;
but it was best on the whole to leave the choice of
treatment to the subjects of the particular monarch
to be dealt with.  He had sided against Karl from an
innate love of excitement and a romantic enthusiasm
for the rebel Princess.  He had saved Karl from
premature death, because he was a well-brought-up
American with a sneaking respect for the sixth
commandment.  The result was, that the revolution,&mdash;which
had been by no means bloodless,&mdash;was likely to
be followed by an aftermath of civil war infinitely more
sanguinary.  Had he not interfered, Karl might still
have been on the throne.  Had he persisted in his
revolutionary policy, logically and relentlessly, Grimland
might have found peace and tranquillity under the
unopposed banner of Gloria.  As it was, Karl was
evidently in Weissheim, and the good Weissheimers,&mdash;according
to Herr Gottfried,&mdash;were preparing glacis
and grapeshot for those who did not see eye to eye
with them in things political.
</p>

<p>
He found his way to the Rubens room, and seated
himself, wondering how long it was necessary to wait
before demanding access to the private apartments.
The short winter day was well-nigh done, and the
great, unlit chamber looked vast and ghostly in the
failing light.  The shadowed corners, the rich
stillness, touched and oppressed his imagination.  Great
men and proud women had passed in sumptuous
pageantry through the walls of that noble chamber;
and Trafford felt their presence, and strove to exorcise
them with the fumes of a cigarette.  But the impalpable
dust of centuries seemed to impregnate the air, and
by-gone monarchs looked askance at him from their dim
gold frames, in a scornful wonder at the American
interloper who sat so carelessly in the seat of kings.
He rose, impatient of their glances, and walked to the
window.  Snow was falling.  The sun that had graced
and greeted the new-crowned Queen had sunk beneath
the rugged outline of the encircling mountains; the
sky, which had been of no uncertain blue, was a
nondescript monotone weeping a white haze of crystalline
tears.  His thoughts harked back to the ashen face
and sad eyes of the new-crowned Queen.  Why had
she not grasped the fact that Karl's immurement in the
<i>Eisenmädchen</i> was a humane act of rescue, not a piece
of callous cruelty?  She herself had experienced the
same hiding-place under the same innocuous conditions,
and yet it did not seem to have occurred to her that the
spikes might still be reposing at the bottom of his
overcoat pocket.  That the others should have failed
to suspect the truth was only natural.  That they
would be angry on discovering it, was probable&mdash;but
for that he cared not one jot.
</p>

<p>
What troubled his awakening conscience was, that
good men and true must go down before peace reigned
again in the troubled monarchy of Grimland.
</p>

<p>
After a few more minutes of such meditation, he
made his way through the Rubens-saal in the direction
of the private apartments.  In the corridor leading to
the Queen's chamber stood the officer on guard, and
talking to him was no less a personage than Von
Hügelweiler.
</p>

<p>
"My orders are precise," the former was saying.
"Her Majesty is resting and will see no one."
</p>

<p>
"But have the goodness at least to send in my
name," Von Hügelweiler returned pettishly.
</p>

<p>
"It would be no use, Captain," retorted the
other.  "The Queen is resting and must not be
disturbed."
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler's disappointment showed itself
plainly in his crestfallen air.
</p>

<p>
"I want access to her Majesty," he said doggedly.
"It is true that by admitting me you risk offending
the Queen, but by not admitting me you offend me for
a certainty."
</p>

<p>
"I am very sorry, Captain," said the officer in a
conciliatory manner.  He was quite a young man,
and he was rather alarmed at having to defy so
important a person as Von Hügelweiler had become.
Still, he held stoutly to his position in the centre of the
corridor.
</p>

<p>
"You may be sorrier still, if you persist," said the
Captain darkly, detecting, as he fancied, symptoms of
wavering on the other's part.  "We move in strange
times, Lieutenant, and my goodwill is better worth
having than my enmity."
</p>

<p>
At this juncture, Trafford,&mdash;who had overheard this
conversation, and whose approach had been inaudible
on the thick carpet of the Palace corridor,&mdash;coughed
affectedly, and advanced with admirable swagger.
</p>

<p>
"I wish to see her Majesty," he said, addressing
the lieutenant on guard, and completely ignoring Von
Hügelweiler.
</p>

<p>
It was the latter, however, who answered him.
</p>

<p>
"The Queen is resting, and will see no one," he said
roughly.
</p>

<p>
Trafford paid not the slightest attention to the
Captain's words.
</p>

<p>
"My name is Trafford," he went on, to the officer.
</p>

<p>
The Lieutenant's face was a picture of puzzled
dismay.  His orders were to conduct Trafford to the
royal apartments as soon as he presented himself.  To
all others he was to give the message that her Majesty
was exceedingly fatigued and would on no account see
anyone.  After a moment's embarrassed indecision,&mdash;during
which he felt Von Hügelweiler's eyes absolutely
scorching him,&mdash;he bade Trafford follow, and turning
his back on the furious Captain, led the way down the
long corridor.  Arriving at a doorway concealed by a
heavy curtain, he pushed open a massive oak portal
and signalled Trafford to enter.
</p>

<p>
The chamber in which the latter now found himself
was lofty, smelling of incense, and lit by lamps hanging
from a frescoed ceiling.  At the far end was an altar
garnished with many candles and a silver crucifix.
</p>

<p>
This undoubtedly was the private chapel of the
Neptunburg.
</p>

<p>
"We are awaiting you," said the quiet voice of Gloria.
</p>

<p>
Trafford advanced towards the new Queen, who was
standing before the steps of the altar in the company
of a priest.  The chapel was dark, for the stained-glass
windows shut out most of the remaining light,
and the hanging lamps were little more than points of
ruby flame.  And yet he could see that Gloria's face
was still of an even pallor, and that her eyes were red
from recent tears.
</p>

<p>
"I am a woman of my word, you see," she went on
in dull tones.  "I promised to marry you under certain
conditions, and, those conditions being fulfilled, I
waste no time."
</p>

<p>
"You are carrying out the letter of the contract,"
returned Trafford, "but are you observing the spirit?
I did not bargain for a tearful bride."
</p>

<p>
"The tears are dried and gone."
</p>

<p>
"But not the cause that made them flow.  You
wept because you are a woman, and the woman who
regards even the formula of marriage as a little matter
has yet to see the light of day.  And you wept
because you are not sure which thing conscience
commands&mdash;the violation of a contract or the taking of
false vows."
</p>

<p>
"You are strangely wise to-day," she said with a
faint smile.  "I did not know such intuition lurked
in that wild brain of yours."
</p>

<p>
"I am right, then?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say"&mdash;she hesitated.  "Yes, the marriage
vow is a serious thing, and this wedding,&mdash;as I
warned you,&mdash;can be no more than a solemn mockery.
I am Queen of Grimland.  You are a brave man
and a gentleman&mdash;but you are not a prince of blood
royal."
</p>

<p>
"The Traffords are not people of particularly
humble origin," he retorted drily.
</p>

<p>
"Nor would it affect me if they were.  But the
State would never sanction my marriage with a commoner."
</p>

<p>
"Then is it worth while going through the
mockery?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"I have asked myself that question, and the answer
is that you find me here.  My word is pledged."
</p>

<p>
"Your word, but not your heart."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but I once told you that I had no heart."
</p>

<p>
"Then you uttered a falsehood," he insisted.  "Your
heart,&mdash;whose existence you deny,&mdash;bled at the thought
of Karl's suffering.  Your heart, which was disposed
to entertain some kindly emotion for me, has cooled
towards me because I compassed Karl's cruel demise."
</p>

<p>
"Go on, wise man!"
</p>

<p>
"I will not ask you if I am right," pursued Trafford,
"for I read acquiescence in those tear-spoiled
eyes.  But I will say one thing more: as Queen of
Grimland your marriage to me will be null and void.
What if you are deposed from your sovereignty, and
became again Gloria von Schattenberg, the exile?"
</p>

<p>
"That will not occur just yet," she replied.
</p>

<p>
"I am not so certain," he mused.  "What if those
rumours mentioned by Gottfried were true in substance
and in fact?  What if Karl really escaped with
General Meyer and Saunders and others to Weissheim?
What if Grimland's King is still in his own
country, alive, alert, surrounded by sage counsel and
loyal hearts?  Is your position then so very sure?"
</p>

<p>
"But Karl was put into the <i>Eisenmädchen</i>," she
protested wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"So were you," was Trafford's retort.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;yes.  But you had unscrewed all the spikes.
The Maiden was as harmless as an unfanged snake."
</p>

<p>
"I put those spikes in my overcoat pocket," said
Trafford slowly.  "They are still&mdash;in my overcoat
pocket."
</p>

<p>
For a dazed moment Gloria stood staring at him.
Then she reeled&mdash;literally&mdash;grasping at the altar rails
for support.
</p>

<p>
"You put him into the Iron Maiden&mdash;to save his
life?" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
"That was my rough idea.  You see, I am an
American, and I hate killing things&mdash;especially brave
things.  There are plenty of men I would kill in the
heat of battle&mdash;one or two, perhaps, whom I would
kill without much heat, but Karl,&mdash;whatever his deeds
or misdeeds,&mdash;was playing the man that night in the
Palace yard, and I would sooner have cut off my right
hand then have done him an injury.  Forgive me, your
Majesty, for I served you badly.  Providence, which
gave me a fair share of muscle and brute courage,
was stinting to me in the matter of logic.  I should
have been logical and replaced the spikes in the
<i>Eisenmädchen</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Herr Trafford!"
</p>

<p>
A hand was laid on Trafford's arm, and in the scanty
light of the shadowy chapel the American found himself
looking into eyes bright with tears, but tears not
of sorrow or vexation, but of happiness and vast relief.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what a weight you have taken from off my
heart&mdash;it was heavier than I could bear," she
murmured.  "I felt like a murderess, a guilty creature
who had risen through blood to the summit of her base
ambitions."
</p>

<p>
"Then I am forgiven?"
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing to forgive.  You have helped me
and served me with your splendid impetuosity and your
fearless resource.  A Grimlander would have slain
Karl, and crowned his service with a deed of shame.
You were illogical&mdash;and I&mdash;I almost love you for your
noble lack of logic."
</p>

<p>
"You almost love me?" he asked in a trance.
</p>

<p>
"At least as much as I have ever loved&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She broke off suddenly, and smiling upon him one
of her rarest smiles, she added: "Yes, George Trafford,
I will marry you, and if the Queen of Grimland
cannot wed an American, then I will no longer be Queen
of Grimland."
</p>

<p>
Trafford gazed into the pale, brave face as he had
never gazed at any living thing.  His breath caught
with a short gasp.  A strange fire had sprung to
quivering life in his bosom; a wild march was pealing in
his ravished ears.  His feet were no longer on the
chequered marble pavement of the Chapel Royal, but
somewhere in the fine regions of rolling planets and
shimmering nebulae.  It was no mere human being
who bent over that sweet young face and kissed the
warm tears from the drooping eyelids as he breathed
the one word "Gloria" in an echo of long-drawn
sound, but a demi-god, an heroic anachronism with
the passions of Phoebus in his kindling soul.
</p>

<p>
"I thought love was worship," he said, as he
strained the slim form to him.  "So it is, and
something more&mdash;something infinitely and deliciously
more."
</p>

<p>
"We are in church," she remonstrated, gently
disengaging herself, "and not alone."
</p>

<p>
But again he kissed her, and this time gently on the
brow.
</p>

<p>
"I was forgetting all things save one," he said,
"and that is that you love me."
</p>

<p>
"Almost love you," she corrected, with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"At least as much as you loved the others," he
affirmed.
</p>

<p>
"And that contents you?" she demanded, raising
her eyebrows in well-feigned astonishment.
</p>

<p>
Her question puzzled him.
</p>

<p>
"It ought not to, of course," he said with wrinkled
brow.  "I ought to want all or nothing.  But I would
be content if it were even less you gave, for in the dim
light of this ancient chamber I seem to see the
workings of Fate."
</p>

<p>
"Then you are willing on such a basis to go on with
the ceremony?"
</p>

<p>
"If you are content to do so," he returned gravely,
"knowing that Karl is alive and may prevail, and that
in that event no Parliament will trouble to undo what
the good priest does this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
Gloria looked him frankly in the face.
</p>

<p>
"I, too, believe in Fate," she said softly, after a
pause; and then, slipping her arm into his, "Father
Ambrose, you have been summoned here for a purpose.
Fulfil that purpose."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER TWENTY
<br><br>
BERNHARDT DISTURBED
</h3>

<p>
While the woman whom he had helped to a throne
was being secretly married to George Trafford, Father
Bernhardt was sitting alone in his private apartments
in the Neptunburg.  The room he had chosen for his
use was a small chamber on the second floor, overlooking
the courtyard.  The blinds were drawn, the
electric light was burning, and the ex-priest was seated
in a comfortable arm-chair reading the poems of Paul
Verlaine.  At his side were a wine-glass and a big
<i>carafe</i> containing a pale green viscous fluid.  He
seemed to be enjoying his relaxation, for a smile
constantly flitted across his face, and as some mordant line
appealed more especially to his grim humour he
would repeat it several times out loud in manifest
appreciation.  From time to time he sipped the fluid
at his elbow, and it was remarkable that each time he
did so he cast a quick look behind him as if fully
expecting to see someone.
</p>

<p>
A rap at the door brought a slight frown to his
brow, and the knock had to be repeated before he
gave the necessary permission to enter.  The intruder
was Von Hügelweiler.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what is it, Captain?" asked Bernhardt impatiently.
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler's glance took in the nature of the
other man's diversion, and a suspicion of contempt
showed itself in his curling lip.
</p>

<p>
"I have news, sir," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Out with it!"
</p>

<p>
"Karl is alive!"
</p>

<p>
"So Gottfried said.  The Iron Maiden seems to
have grown humane in her old age."
</p>

<p>
Hügelweiler studied the man whose influence was
then paramount in Weidenbruck, and his contempt
grew.  In common with others, he had been wont to
fear Bernhardt.  The burning eyes, the quick,
imperious brain, the general air of reckless strength were
things that impressed the well-born soldier, as they
impressed the low-born mob.  But Bernhardt sipping
absinthe was a different person from the fire-brand
of the revolution, and Hügelweiler realised that the
lethargic sensualist of the arm-chair needed strong
words to rouse him.
</p>

<p>
"The Iron Maiden has not grown humane," he
said, "but there is a traitor in our midst."
</p>

<p>
Bernhardt sipped pensively.
</p>

<p>
"How very interesting!" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Very!" echoed Hügelweiler scornfully.  "Before
Karl was put into the <i>Eisenmädchen</i> someone had
removed the spikes.  The pretended execution was
nothing more nor less than a scheme to save the King's
life."
</p>

<p>
"A most ingenious scheme."
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler banged his fist on the table.
</p>

<p>
"That is one piece of news!" he cried irritably.
"It does not seem to move you very deeply; perhaps
my second item will affect you more.  The Queen has
just gone through the ceremony of marriage with
Trafford the American!"
</p>

<p>
Again Bernhardt raised his glass.
</p>

<p>
"I drink to the happy pair," he said blandly.
</p>

<p>
Hügelweiler almost screamed with vexation.
</p>

<p>
"It is scandalous!" he protested, almost with tears
in his eyes.  "The thing must be annulled.  The Queen
of Grimland must not wed a commoner, a foreign
adventurer, a man who at a crisis turns traitor and
saves the dethroned King's life."
</p>

<p>
A spark of interest glinted into the ex-priest's eye.
</p>

<p>
"By the way," he asked, "how did you find all this out?"
</p>

<p>
The question let loose a fresh flood of indignation
from the Captain.  In tones of choking wrath he told
how he had been forbidden the royal presence, and how
Trafford had been accorded instant admission.
</p>

<p>
"That was too much for a man of my kidney," he
went on.  "I brushed aside the young fool who was
doing duty on guard, and I followed this American
pig down the corridor.  I found myself in the chapel,
and I hid myself in the gloom behind a pew.  Then
I overheard things&mdash;pretty things, pretty speeches,
tales of the American's mercy, how he had saved the
King's life because he disliked killing a brave man.
Then these two,&mdash;the Queen of Grimland and the traitor
who should have been immured in the Strafeburg,&mdash;kissed
each other and were made man and wife by a
damned old fool in a cassock."
</p>

<p>
"Always speak respectfully of the Church, my son,"
said Bernhardt with exasperating mockery.  "I was,
myself, one of its most shining ornaments."
</p>

<p>
"Can nothing rouse you to the seriousness of the
situation?" demanded the Captain in despair.
</p>

<p>
Again Bernhardt sipped.  Then he leaned back,
and a slow smile spread over his face.
</p>

<p>
"You don't drink absinthe, do you, Captain?"
</p>

<p>
"No," replied the other with an expression of disgust.
</p>

<p>
"It is a strange fluid," went on Bernhardt thoughtfully.
"Sometimes it clears the brain, so that one
sees with extraordinary distinctness.  But sometimes
it obfuscates the reasoning powers, so that one
cannot distinguish right from wrong.  For instance, at
the present moment, <i>Herr</i> Trafford's action appears
to me not a wicked, but a positively virtuous one.  He
saved a man from a cruel death and delivers him to
freedom instead of torture."
</p>

<p>
"But the man was Karl!" expostulated Von Hügelweiler.
</p>

<p>
"I loved Karl," returned Bernhardt, unmoved, "I
loved and hated him.  You,&mdash;not being an <i>absintheur</i>,&mdash;cannot
understand the curious mental pose that loves
and hates the same being at the same time.  Also I
love Herr Trafford.  He got me out of the Strafeburg."
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler made a gesture of despair.  He
felt he was talking to a madman, one on whom sense
and argument were useless and unavailing.
</p>

<p>
"But the marriage!" he said, raising his voice
unconsciously to a shout in the desperate effort to drive
home his point.  "The marriage must be cancelled!
When the truth is known that Trafford helped Karl
to escape he will become the most hated man in
Weidenbruck.  The Queen must never unite her fortunes with
such a creature."
</p>

<p>
Bernhardt gaped, as if the matter had begun to
bore him.
</p>

<p>
"Then the truth must not be known," he said,
between his yawns.
</p>

<p>
"But it shall be known!" cried the soldier angrily.
"I shall proclaim it myself from the housetops.  The
mad American must be whipped out of the country."
</p>

<p>
"Captain von Hügelweiler," said the ex-priest
solemnly, "just now I was enjoying two things: some
deliciously bitter poetry and some deliciously bitter
liquid.  At the present moment I am incapacitated by
your disturbing presence from enjoying either.  Do I
make myself plain?"
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler turned to go with a stifled oath.
</p>

<p>
"A fine time for dissipation!" he said, as a parting
shaft.  "The fortunes of the country are at stake,
and Bernhardt, Father Bernhardt, the people's leader,
the man of the hour, swills absinthe and absorbs the
pernicious writings of a decadent poetaster."
</p>

<p>
In a flash the ex-priest was on his feet, with blazing
eyes and an air of almost terrible menace.  Von
Hügelweiler thought he had been talking to a sodden
drunkard.  He found himself confronted by the
embodiment of masterful and savage energy.
</p>

<p>
"You fool!" cried Bernhardt in tones of withering
contempt.  "May not a man rest?  May not a strange
man rest in a strange way?  I do the work of a
hundred&mdash;must not the brain be fed and the nerves braced
to meet the strain?"
</p>

<p>
The Captain shrugged his shoulders weakly.
Despite his own strong feelings, the other's
imperiousness cowed him.
</p>

<p>
"Go!" continued Bernhardt, pointing to the door.
"Go, and hold your peace!  Tell nobody this tale of
Karl's escape and who contrived it.  Tell no one this
tale of the secret marriage in the Chapel Royal.  I
forbid you to speak.  The nation's destinies are in my
keeping, not yours."
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler went to the door, smarting under
the lash of the tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Has the American bewitched you, as he has
bewitched Gloria von Schattenberg?" he asked, summoning
up a spark of courage before quitting the room.
</p>

<p>
"Aye," retorted Bernhardt, "he has certain very
fascinating qualities.  He is a man, Von Hügelweiler.
Pray to your God, if you believe in Him, to make you
one."
</p>

<p>
And with an oath on his lips, and wrath and rebellion
in his heart, Von Hügelweiler flung himself from the
ex-priest's chamber.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap21"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
<br><br>
DREAMS
</h3>

<p>
The following morning George Trafford awoke from
sweet dreams to the pleasant consciousness of hot coffee
and crisp rolls.  He was still occupying apartments
in the Hôtel Concordia, and it was a waiter in that
excellent establishment who roused him from the glories
of slumberland at the hour of 8.30.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Rudolf," said Trafford, opening
a reluctant eye.  "I trust you have not forgotten my
honey this morning."
</p>

<p>
"I have brought the honey, your Excellency; also a
letter."  Trafford glanced at the handwriting on the
envelope.
</p>

<p>
"Sweeter also than the honey and the honeycomb,"
he murmured.  "A letter from dreamland, Rudolf!
Tell me, Rudolf, do waiters dream?"
</p>

<p>
The man laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Not often, Excellency.  They are too busy by
day.  Once I dreamed that I was appointed headwaiter
at the Concordia."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! you are ambitious, Rudolf.  My dreams are
less exalted.  I only dreamed that a certain <i>gnadiges
fräulein</i> did more than 'almost' love me; that she even
cared for me 'more than the others.'  It was not a
bad dream, Rudolf," he added, casting his eyes over the
missive, "and the letter is not a bad awakening."
</p>

<p>
"You have read it, Excellency?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is short and sweet.  '<i>Meet me at the
confectioner's at the corner of the Königstrasse and the
Etizabethstrasse at eleven.</i>'  That is all, but the
imagination riots at the choice of rendezvous.  A sensuous
woman would have chosen a restaurant, an extravagant
one a milliner's.  Only a sweet one could have
thought of a pastrycook's."
</p>

<p>
"I wish your Excellency joy."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Rudolf; my small change is reposing
on the edge of the mantelpiece; kindly select a
five-krone piece and drink to my good fortune."
</p>

<p>
At eleven o'clock Trafford was waiting outside a
big corner shop, whose ample windows revealed an
alluring wealth of edible magnificence.  Hardly had
the church clock finished striking when a young woman
drew near.  The combination of blue veil and Russian
sables was one Trafford had seen before, and being in
uniform he saluted.
</p>

<p>
"Come inside," said Gloria.
</p>

<p>
Trafford followed obediently.
</p>

<p>
"It's so like you to meet me in a place of this kind,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"We must meet somewhere," she returned, and there
was a half-mischievous glint in the eyes that looked
back into his eyes as she added:&mdash;"after what
happened yesterday.  It's no good meeting at the
Neptunburg&mdash;a palace has all the luxuries of an ideal home,
except privacy.  This is one of the places where I was
known in my days of exile, and they will serve us
chocolate and éclairs in a private room."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know I dreamed of you last night," began
Trafford, as soon as they were alone in a cosy little
room at the back.
</p>

<p>
"Naturally," she laughed.
</p>

<p>
"And in my dream you were very kind."
</p>

<p>
"Again, naturally."
</p>

<p>
"I mean," said Trafford tentatively, "you loved
me 'more than the others.'"
</p>

<p>
"You are most diverting," she said, smiling.
</p>

<p>
Trafford winced.
</p>

<p>
"You are not taking me very seriously?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"How can I take anything very seriously?  If I did,
I should go mad.  I am a Queen, and Queens must
marry.  Custom compels.  As an exile I had no
difficulty in maintaining my spinsterhood.  Now, it is
different.  If I do not marry you&mdash;marry you, mind, not
merely go through a marriage form with you&mdash;I shall
be wedded to some young German or Austrian Princeling,
whose standard of manhood is measured by the
number of beer <i>seidles</i> he can empty in an evening."
</p>

<p>
"I am flattered.  And now for a few practical
considerations.  Supposing you marry me&mdash;and like you,
I am using the word in its fullest sense&mdash;what will be
the result?  What will the public say?"
</p>

<p>
"The public will say little, but it will do a good
deal," said Gloria grimly.  "It is true we are moving
in a time of great changes; it is true that for the
moment you are a very popular person.  But it is also
true that I am a Queen and you a commoner, and
Grimlanders like their Royalty undiluted.  If we proclaimed
ourselves man and wife we should be wise to board the
Orient express at Gleis, and steam westward to Ostend
or eastward to Constantinople."
</p>

<p>
"And you would really&mdash;really object to that
course?" asked Trafford a little sadly.  "Yesterday
afternoon you said, 'If the Queen of Grimland may
not wed an American I will no longer be Queen of
Grimland.'"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but I spoke in a moment of enthusiasm,"
declared Gloria unblushingly.  "I had been oppressed by
the nightmare of Karl's supposed assassination.  The
fact that he had not really been killed, that it was your
ready wit that saved him from a cruel end, warmed
my heart wonderfully towards you.  But if you had
your dream last night, so had I.  Mine was less
sentimental but equally pleasant.  In it I saw myself
Queen of Grimland, Queen of a whole country, with
no district in revolt against me.  Karl had been
defeated, captured, and exiled.  I was the reigning
sovereign of a loyal and loving people."
</p>

<p>
Trafford nodded gravely.
</p>

<p>
"That is the dream of a Schattenberg," he said.
"It is much the same dream that your father dreamed
before he fell into the great sleep where there are no
dreams.  But it is not the dream of the woman I kissed
yesterday afternoon in the Chapel Royal of the
Neptunburg."
</p>

<p>
Gloria's eyes fell before his steadfast gaze.  Her
face softened; it saddened under a wave of emotion&mdash;an
emotion, the instant expression of which, though
easily attributable to her actress-temperament, was
nevertheless based on something far deeper.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if I am a hard woman," she began, still
looking down.  "Years of exile, of earning one's living
on the variety stage, striving&mdash;surely these are not
softening influences."  She paused for him to add some
sympathetic word.  Whether he intended to do so or
not, he forgot it on meeting the eyes that now were
looking him through and through, as she continued:
"But I do not unsay what I said yesterday!  I really
like you, immensely&mdash;and perhaps I almost love you."
</p>

<p>
Trafford took her hand and kissed it rapturously;
she almost snatched it away, and there was a ring of
steel in the tones that now declared:
</p>

<p>
"But I have tasted power, and now that the horror
of Karl's death is no longer on my conscience, I wish
to be the unopposed ruler of my country."
</p>

<p>
"Even though the process of establishing your rule
costs the lives of brave men?"
</p>

<p>
Again she dropped her eyes&mdash;was silenced.  She
sipped her chocolate.  When she spoke, it was quietly
and with absolute conviction.
</p>

<p>
"If I had known what Father Bernhardt told us,
that Karl was really a humane man and was absolutely
innocent of the Archbishop's death, I don't
believe I should have headed a rebellion against him.
But&mdash;rightly or wrongly&mdash;the rebellion has succeeded and
the seat of government is mine.  To falter now would
be to cause more misery and bloodshed than to go on.
The people have declared against Karl, and Karl they
will not have at any price.  If I were to abdicate, some
other adventurer would take my place.  To withdraw
myself from Grimland now would be to leave my friends
to the certain reprisals of their enemies."
</p>

<p>
"Your argument is flawless," acknowledged Trafford.
"I am <i>de trop</i>.  Ambition, to say nothing of
humanity, leaves you but one course.  Neither do I
complain&mdash;though I shall return a disappointed man.
You are not heartless, far from it, for yesterday in
a moment of golden light I caught a glimpse of a
great splendour, the gorgeous harmonies of a woman's
heart.  The vision has faded, and again I say I do not
complain.  On the contrary, I thank Providence for the
vision of what might have been."
</p>

<p>
A more prolonged silence followed these words.
Trafford busied himself with his éclair, while his
companion continued to stir her chocolate, till a veritable
whirlpool formed in its opaque depths.  At last she
looked up.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I'm not heartless," she said,&mdash;and she
smiled as a coquette might smile on being told that
her flirtations were dangerous,&mdash;"and of course, I like
you very much, only you miss the whole gist of my
argument.  If we announce our marriage now we shall
be drummed out of the country.  That might suit
you, but it doesn't harmonise with the ideals that have
been instilled into me from my earliest years.  If you
accompany me in this projected expedition to
Weissheim,&mdash;not as my husband, but as my officer,&mdash;if you
exert your skill and valour on my behalf and help to
capture Karl and win me back my old home&mdash;the
Marienkastel&mdash;there is no knowing what the enthusiasm
of the Grimlander would not do for you.  If we
return as conquerers, what more fitting crown to our
pageant than the union of the vindicated Queen and
her triumphant General?"
</p>

<p>
Trafford gazed at the mantled cheek and the light
of expectancy that shone in her eyes now.  Certain
words of Saunders' came back, ringing in his ears:
"When you really fall in love you will refuse to take
'No' for an answer.  In the words of the pre-historic
doggerel, you will 'try, try again.'"
</p>

<p>
"I see," he said, "I have done something, but I
have not done enough.  I will accompany you to
Weissheim&mdash;a unit of your force&mdash;and I will do my best
to serve your cause.  What has passed between us is
nothing, must make no difference in our relations, is
merely the burlesque conclusion of a burlesque
compact.  I thought I saw the working of Fate in the
incensed gloom of the Chapel Royal.  The next few
weeks will prove me an idle visionary or a true
seer."  He paused.  "Which do you wish me to prove?"
</p>

<p>
She rose to her feet, opened her sable cloak, and
disengaged a pearl brooch from her neck.  Bending over
him so that her breath swept his cheek, she fastened
the trinket to the lapel of his green tunic, and finished
his subjugation with a long look into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"A true seer," she answered.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
<br><br>
THE WAR ON THE WINE-SHOP
</h3>

<p>
Outside the confectioner's Gloria let down her veil
again, and turned her steps towards the Neptunburg.
Trafford, at her request, took the opposite direction.
His habitually fierce features wore a grimmer
look than ever,&mdash;for his brows were knit and his teeth
set,&mdash;and there was a dangerous gleam in his grey
eyes.  He was the prey to a host of indefinable
emotions, that worked his turbulent spirit to its most
aggressive mood.  Disappointment, a tinge of bitterness,
coupled with a wild sense of intoxication,&mdash;caused
by the Princess's last relenting act of grace,&mdash;had
strung his fine nervous system to a point when it
demanded violent action as the only possible relief.  Had
he been at Harvard he would have kindled a bonfire;
had Karl been within a reasonable radius of his activity
he would have headed a cutting-out expedition to
capture that unhappy monarch.  As it was, he walked fast,
bending his steps unconsciously towards his hotel.  The
sky showed a pale blue between the lines of house-tops,
for as usual the sun was having its morning duel with
the white fog that haunts the streets of Weidenbruck
at this period of the year.  The sun was winning,
too,&mdash;as it generally did for an hour or so,&mdash;and even
causing the huge icicles that hung from the eaves to drip
a little at their sharp and glistening extremities.  But
Trafford noted none of these things.
</p>

<p>
"I am very ill or very much too well," he said to
himself, in diagnosis of his own feverish unrest.  "If
I were an Elizabethan courtier I should write a
sonnet; if I were an ordinary American I should play
tennis or golf.  Being neither, I am suffering
the torments of a wild beast in a small cage;
my brain is bursting from enforced inaction.
Saunders, who is always right, calls me a madman, and to
justify his opinion I shall probably break a shop
window in about two minutes."
</p>

<p>
Whether or no he had the slightest intention of
putting his insane threat into execution, he looked
behind him to see if he were observed.  A couple of
men were following a few paces in his rear.  To his
excited fancy there seemed something sinister about
their muffled forms.  One carried a thick stick, and
both seemed to look on him with eyes of malice.
</p>

<p>
"As I live, I believe they are going to attack me,"
he said gleefully to himself.  "No," he reflected, "the
wish is father to the thought.  There is not the
slightest reason why they should attack me.  They
are probably respectable burghers doing a morning's
shopping in the Königstrasse."
</p>

<p>
The original idea, however, fascinated him, and
he stopped; the men stopped too.  He went on, and
the men went on, and a backward glance told him that
they were summoning a third person from across the
street, and pointing at him as an object either of
curiosity or offence.  He continued his walk with a wild
hope in his heart, and in the course of a hundred yards
the hope became a certainty.  A small crowd was now
dogging his footsteps, and such uncomplimentary
references as "traitor," "spy" and "<i>schweinhund</i>"
assailed his ears.  The situation would have alarmed most
men, and would have accorded even "Nervy"
Trafford a certain measure of uneasiness under ordinary
conditions.  But in his present state of psychical
unrest the atmosphere of danger had a marvellously
relieving effect.  The fever went out of his bones, his
blood slackened to a normal speed, his brain adjusted
itself to meet the crisis.  He was still spoiling for a
fight, but seething pugnacity had given way to ice-cool
combativeness.  He walked on without quickening
his pace, and though he looked neither to right nor
left, he felt instinctively that the numbers of his retinue
were swelling fast.  The hum of muttered execrations
rose to a stronger note, and every yard of his
progress brought fresh idlers in his wake.  From time
to time he passed a policeman, but these were
gorgeously uniformed officials whose idea of upholding
civic dignity was to adopt a pose of statuesque
aloofness to things human and divine.
</p>

<p>
Presently a piece of frozen snow struck him on
the nape of his neck.  He swung round in a fury, and
as he did so the foremost of the pack struck his shako
from his head.
</p>

<p>
"Von Hügelweiler!" he cried, recognising in his
roughly-clad assailant the Captain of the Guard; and
quick as thought he planted a sledge-hammer blow
full in his rival's face.  The Captain staggered and
fell, and profiting by the diversion, Trafford crossed
the wide street and plunged into a narrow alley.  He
was running now, doubling in and out of the congested
slums that formed this quarter of the town: and
if there was no fear in his heart, there was a growing
appreciation of the fact that his life was in danger,
and that a single-handed contest with an infuriated
mob was an unsatisfactory way of working off superfluous
energy.  For a space he threaded his rapid way
through the winding alleys round the Goose-market,
but the hue and cry was strong, and the neighbourhood
seemed momentarily more fit for deeds of violence.
</p>

<p>
But Trafford had not lost his head, and there was
a motive in his flight that was born of quick thought
and prospective vengeance rather than panic fear.  At
the door of a certain wine-shop he halted breathless;
a backward glance showed his nearest pursuer fifty
yards distant.
</p>

<p>
"Herr Krantz!" he called, bursting into the brasserie.
</p>

<p>
"Mein Herr?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you recognise me?"
</p>

<p>
The man surveyed him coolly.
</p>

<p>
"I never forget a face, Excellency," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"Good!" said Trafford.  "And are you still loyal
to the good Queen Gloria?"
</p>

<p>
The man nodded as if the question was unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
"Then you will help me," said Trafford; "I am
being attacked by her enemies."
</p>

<p>
Hardly had he spoken when a wild-looking man
entered the shop with upraised bludgeon and a cry of
"Traitor!"  Trafford picked up a convenient beer-can
and floored the intruder with a well-directed blow.
</p>

<p>
"Close the door and shut the shutters!" called out
Trafford, drawing his sword and holding at bay a
couple of ruffians who had outrun the main body of his
pursuers.
</p>

<p>
There was little time to spare, but there were one
or two early customers of Herr Krantz, who lent
instant and unquestioning aid.  These helped Trafford
told the narrow street till the landlord had set his oaken
shutters in front of the glass shop-front.  Then, as
the increasing pressure threatened to overwhelm them,
they darted into the shop, banged the door, and shot
the massive bolts.  A rattle of blows resounded on the
woodwork, and a chorus of fierce cries came in strident
chorus from the crowded lane.  Krantz switched up
the electric light to relieve the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"I will telephone for the police," he said.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Trafford, who did not share his host's
confidence in the Weidenbruck constabulary.  "Ring
up the Palace."
</p>

<p>
Krantz retired to the telephone in the inner room,
and the hammering on door and shutters went on with
redoubled violence.
</p>

<p>
"What is it that they want?" asked the inmates
of the shop of Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"Me," replied the latter.
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
Trafford had but the vaguest idea, but he answered
boldly:
</p>

<p>
"Because I am the Queen's friend."
</p>

<p>
"I have given a message that you are here and in
danger," said Herr Krantz, returning.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks.  Are your shutters sound?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe so, Excellency."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad to hear it.  I think we should be well
advised to go to an upper window and survey the
prospect."
</p>

<p>
Krantz assented, and led the way up a dark and
narrow stair to a room on the first floor.  Opening the
double windows, Trafford surveyed a scene of many
heads; the confined thoroughfare was literally crammed
with a sea of human beings.  All were shouting,
and those whose position enabled them to do so were
banging against the defences with sticks and fists.
</p>

<p>
"I trust Herr Krantz's shutters are as sound as he
thinks," he muttered looking down on the surging
mass of his enemies.  "What an excitable folk these
good Weidenbruckers are!  I suppose that cross-grained
beast, Von Hügelweiler, has been concocting
some evil tale about me, and is egging them on to
pull me to pieces in revenge for his defeat on the
Rundsee.  But he finds me in good fighting trim, and
I will follow up that blow on the nose with other
attentions if I get half a chance."
</p>

<p>
He craned his head sideways, to take full stock of
his adversaries, and as he did so it came into contact
with a huge icicle, one of the many that hung like
gigantic dragon's teeth from the over-hanging eaves.
The slight shock to his cranium instilled a fresh idea.
</p>

<p>
"Have you any snow on your roof, Herr Krantz?"
he asked, drawing back into the room.
</p>

<p>
"The pitch is steep and throws off the snow,
Excellency, but there may be a hundredweight or two."
</p>

<p>
"And can we get on to the roof?"
</p>

<p>
"If you will."
</p>

<p>
"We might create a diversion," pursued Trafford.
"A little snow distributed scientifically on the heads
of these good people might have a wonderfully cooling
effect on their heated tempers."
</p>

<p>
Krantz doubted the wisdom of further infuriating
the mob, but Trafford's enthusiasm was infectious, and
he won his way.
</p>

<p>
A steep ladder and a trap-door gave access to the
tiled roof.  A shovel was procured, and in a few
seconds a small avalanche was dislodged on to the more
aggressive bombarders of the oak shutters.  The
effect was excellent, and a desire to edge away from
the immediate proximity of the wine-shop manifested
itself.  Trafford, however, was seen, and his image
served to increase the streperous chorus of
execration below.  He replied with a mocking bow and a
shovel-full of snow tossed lightly into the middle of
the throng.  For the moment he held the advantage:
curses were met with jeers; threats with a polite
obeisance; any symptom of action was countered with a
swift reprisal of hurtling snow.  But the situation was
not allowed to remain definitely favourable.  Among
the crowd was someone with an intelligent brain as well
as an excitable nature.  Von Hügelweiler at this time
was as full of the sentiment of human hate as an
insulted and disappointed egotist could be.  The blow he
had received had been the last straw.  A bullet in his
breast or a sword through his arm would not have
burned with such a fire of shame as the crude, coarse
shock of his rival's fist.  All sense of proportion, all
notion of justice, let alone mercy, had long ago been
swamped by the bitter tide of maddening disappointment
which poisoned his best instincts.  And now
the lust of vengeance,&mdash;baulked for the moment by his
enemy's resource,&mdash;led him to do rather a clever thing.
There was a small fire-station hard by Krantz's
brasserie, and this, with the assistance of his chosen
followers, Von Hügelweiler raided.  A few minutes
later, helmet on head and axe in hand, he and some
half-dozen desperadoes returned hopefully to the attack.
</p>

<p>
As the first axe-blow crashed into the oaken woodwork,
Trafford sent a mass of snow on to the assailant.
The man shook under the weight, but his helmet
protected him, and he went on with his work undeterred.
</p>

<p>
In vain Trafford and his companions shovelled their
crystalline ammunition on to the heads and shoulders
of their attackers; they delayed the work of irruption,
but delayed it immaterially.  It was the crowd's turn
to jeer now, for the axes were playing havoc with the
stout shutters, and it seemed a matter of minutes only
before oak yielded to steel, and the inevitable rush of
furious humanity flooded the beer-house.
</p>

<p>
"We are undone," said one of Trafford's companions;
"we must try and escape over the roofs."
</p>

<p>
"One moment," said Trafford, sprawling at full
length on the tiles, his head hanging over the eaves.
"Herr Krantz, sit on my legs."
</p>

<p>
The proprietor, a man of weight, did as he was bid.
</p>

<p>
With the hilt of his sword Trafford banged at the
base of one of the huge icicles that fringed the
overhanging cornice.  At the third blow it parted&mdash;four
feet of glistening ice pointed to dagger fineness
descended like a javelin on to the back of one of the
storming party.  The man fell without a sound.  A snarl,
half horror and half rage, burst from the crowd.  His
comrades raised his limp and lifeless body from the
snow, and bore it from the danger zone.
</p>

<p>
"Forward again!" cried Von Hügelweiler, furiously
rushing against the shop and burying his hatchet
in the splintering shutter.
</p>

<p>
But Trafford was busy dislodging another icicle of
even more formidable dimensions, and when that was
used there were a score of others.  The men drew back;
one traitor's life was not worth the risk, and Von
Hügelweiler, finding himself unsupported, withdrew
too.
</p>

<p>
Whether caution would have prevailed, or whether
the spirited harangue which Von Hügelweiler now
addressed to his followers would have had its effect,
can never be known.  A diversion, more serious than
hurtling snow or crashing icicle, occurred to change
men's moods.  A troop of horse, cuirassed, high-booted,
armed with naked swords, was making its slow
but irresistible way down the congested thoroughfare;
and in the midst, with black slouch hat and sable
uniform, rode the grimly smiling person of Father
Bernhardt.  A cheer greeted him, for his errand was
unknown, and he might have come, for all they knew, to
help in taking the traitor.  If that was their idea,
however, they were soon undeceived.  The ex-priest's
quick eye detected Von Hügelweiler, and the latter,
reading its sinister message, commenced a hasty
retreat.
</p>

<p>
"Two hundred kronen to the man who brings me
Von Hügelweiler, dead or alive!" called out Bernhardt.
</p>

<p>
There was a movement in the crowd, and in it the
late Captain of the Guard was lost to view.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Father Bernhardt!" cried Trafford
from the roof.  "You arrive at an opportune
moment; her Majesty's lieges were getting troublesome.
At first I contented myself with snow-balling
them, but they turned nasty and I had to despatch an
icicle.  I am afraid one liege was rather hurt."
</p>

<p>
Bernhardt's smile widened as he took in the situation.
</p>

<p>
"A pity it wasn't Von Hügelweiler," he said.  "But
you'd better let me escort you to your rooms.  For
the moment you seem to have fallen out of favour
with the plebs."
</p>

<p>
"I fear so," replied the American, "and had it
not been for good Herr Krantz, I might have fared
badly at the hands of these gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
"Herr Krantz shall be rewarded," said Bernhardt.
"His loyalty is well known and appreciated in the
highest quarter.  And as for these 'gentlemen,' as
you call them," he went on, turning to the mob, "I've
a good mind to give them an experience of a cavalry
charge in a narrow lane."
</p>

<p>
The suggestion was taken literally by the mob, and
something of a panic began in the neighbourhood of the
steel-clad troopers.  But Bernhardt checked the
movement with a quick shout.
</p>

<p>
"Stop, you fools!" he cried, rising in his stirrups
and letting his great voice ring out.  "Stop, and listen
to me before you go about your business&mdash;or your
idling!  What do you mean by this breach of the
peace?  Has there not been trouble enough in the city
of late?  Are you men or wolves, that you hunt a man
through the streets, and pull down the doorway of a
peaceful citizen?"
</p>

<p>
"He is a traitor!" cried one.  "He freed Karl!"
cried another, and a babel of tongues broke out in an
eager flood of accusation.
</p>

<p>
For a moment Bernhardt let them speak.  Then
he raised his hand and won instant silence.
</p>

<p>
"He is not a traitor," he said with slow emphasis.
"He rescued me from the Strafeburg.  Was that the
act of a traitor?  Had it not been for this brave and
resourceful American I should now be rotting in a
dungeon, and you still beneath the yoke of Karl.  It is
true that Karl has fled to Weissheim, but that was a
mistake due to no fault of Trafford's.  And the fault,
whosoever's it was, he will undo, for he accompanies
me to Weissheim, sworn to win back the Marienkastel
from the Queen's enemies."
</p>

<p>
The quiet force of his words carried conviction to his
hearers.  They feared the grim, black figure as a pack
of dogs fears its master, but there was a certain canine
affection in their debased regard.  Bernhardt was a
superior being, one whose word was law.  They heard
and believed, and even began to feel self-reproachful.
</p>

<p>
"For shame on you, men of Weidenbruck!" went
on the ex-priest in upraised tones.  "Shame on you,
I say, compassing harm against the man who delivered
you from tyranny!  This loyal friend of mine, whose
courage and craft you have just experienced to your
own hurt, joins an expedition to Weissheim as my
right-hand man.  A foreigner, he endures hardships
and dangers for your sake and that of your noble
young Queen.  'Traitor,' you called him!  Hero and
liberator would be better titles, I think, for such as he.
With his help there is no fear but that we shall capture
Weissheim from our enemies, and bring back Karl a
prisoner to the capital.  What reward will you have
then for Trafford, the deliverer?  Will you hunt him
through your streets like a mad dog?  Or will you strew
garlands in his path, acclaim him from your housetops&mdash;aye,
and give him the highest in your land to wife!"
</p>

<p>
Assuredly if the power of words is a wonderful thing,
the power of personality is infinitely greater.
Bernhardt had spoken with a certain ready eloquence, a
certain skill of pleading in his client's cause; but
another might have spoken with twice his skill and twice
his oratory, and have failed completely.  It was not
that he followed the temper of the mob and adapted
himself to their moods; rather, he made their moods
for them, and used them to his own sweet will.  When
he reasoned they followed and were convinced, when
he lashed they cringed, when he reproached they
suffered agonies of shame; and at the end he raised their
enthusiasm for the object of their late malice, with the
ease of a consummate master of men, and his last
question was met with a ringing cry of "Long live the
American!  Long live Gloria of Grimland!"  The
ex-priest's smile was more of a sneer than anything&mdash;so
cheap did he hold his triumph over the flaccid minds of
the shifty horde; but his eye wandered to the roof where
Trafford stood, shovel in hand, cheering himself and
his secretly-married wife.
</p>

<p>
"We will escort you to your hotel," Bernhardt called out.
</p>

<p>
"It is not necessary," replied the American.
"Bernhardt the Magician has effected my
metamorphosis&mdash;he has changed me from a fox to a lion."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
<br><br>
THE "BOB" RUN
</h3>

<p>
In the far north of Grimland, seemingly secure in its
snow-blocked passes and its improvised fortifications,
the mountain town of Weissheim basked serenely in
the unclouded sunshine of its exalted plateau.  The
life of the place went on, little affected outwardly by
the rude shocks of a revolution that had unseated a
dynasty at Weidenbruck, and incidentally horrified the
sober-minded people of Europe.  The railway was cut
that connected Weissheim with the capital, and the
telegraph wires were drooping, limp and useless, from
their stark poles.  The foreign contingent,&mdash;the
English and American visitors of the "Pariserhof,"&mdash;pursued
their life of unadulterated pleasure-seeking as
thoroughly and unconcernedly as was their wont.
Each morning found the curling rink well filled with
knickerbockered mortals, bearing brooms, and hurling
granite bowls over the perfect ice, and using weird
expressions of Scottish origin tempered with
Anglo-Saxon profanity.  The snows of the hillsides were
scarred with the double-tracked impressions of
innumerable ski-runners, and the great toboggan run&mdash;the
Kastel run&mdash;found its daily complement of votaries for
its dangerous attractions.  Each night the thermometer
showed its zero frost, and each day the winter sun
proclaimed its potency with no uncertain ray.  Nature
was as serenely unconscious of politics as the guests of
the Pariserhof were of the series of fogs that was at
that time choking the streets of London with obfuscating
blackness.  This winter, indeed, was singularly like
other winters at this ideal resort of athletic and
convalescent humanity.  It is true that horrible tales of
rioting and violence had come through from
Weidenbruck,&mdash;but similar reports had been transmitted many
times previously,&mdash;and if the present rumours were
rather more highly-coloured and substantial than
heretofore, that was no reason why able-bodied men and
women should not skate and ski, and play innumerable
rubbers of bridge over cups of hot chocolate and
cream-stuffed <i>éclairs au café</i>.  It was true that bands of
swarthy men in uniform, and armed with shovels, were
perpetually throwing up snow-works on the surrounding
bluffs, but they respected the skating-rinks and the
toboggan-runs&mdash;which was all the visitors cared about.
Moreover, they furnished rather a picturesque note
as they dragged their grim pieces of ordnance over the
steep snow slopes, and slowly hauled them into position
in the aforementioned snow-works.  What the guests
of the Pariserhof failed to appreciate was, that a
miracle was taking place.  Weissheim was loyal!
Weissheim,&mdash;for years the home of sedition and
intrigue,&mdash;was all for Karl!  Just as in the days of his
prosperity it had turned against him, so now in the
hour of his discomfiture it rallied to him as one man.
The troubles of 1904 had taught the good Weissheimers
that they had a man for a Sovereign, that the tall,
good-natured, sunburnt gentleman in spectacles had a
hard fist inside his fur-lined gloves, and a stout heart
under his Jäeger cardigan.  And the fact that
Weidenbruck had cast him out was a good enough reason
for their taking him in.  The men of the mountain
despised the dwellers of the plain.  Rough, cruel,
mutable as they were, there were still certain primitive
virtues among the hardy hill-folk, and when one day
Karl and the ever-popular Saunders turned up
unexpectedly at Weissheim with their tale of woe, they let
loose an enthusiasm that had never yet been accorded
to Grimland's legitimate Sovereign.  So, contrary to
his fears, Meyer's task had been an easy one.  A more
than capable engineer, he soon put the place on as
sound a footing of defence as shovel and energy directed
by German book-lore and Jewish brains could put it.
Within a week of his arrival the whole plateau was
secure in its well-planned redoubts and in the excellent
temper of the civil and military population.
</p>

<p>
On the twentieth of January, eight days after the
King's arrival, the race for the Cobham Cup took place
on the bob-sleigh run.  For this event bob-sleigh crews
had foregathered from far and near, for the Weissheim
"bob" run is acknowledged to be the fastest, the
most difficult, and the most sporting in the world.  A
bob-sleigh,&mdash;let me explain for the benefit of the
uninitiated,&mdash;is a very long toboggan capable of holding
half a dozen persons.  Unlike an ordinary toboggan, it
is steered from the front by ropes, or, in the most
up-to-date "bobs," by a wheel.  The rearmost man
manipulates a brake with a lever on either hand, and he
awaits the commands of the steersman, who sees the
curves coming and realises when the pace must be
checked to avert disaster.  Originally, the "bobbing"
was done along the high road, but this was so
dangerous to horse-sleighs and pedestrians, and resulted
in such fearful accidents, that a special track was
constructed every winter, avoiding the town and ultimately
joining the highway somewhere near Riefinsdorf.  The
winning-post was now at this junction, but for ordinary
pleasure "bobbing," crews sometimes continued their
course along the road itself, the constant declivity
permitting the craft to travel at a great speed almost as
far as Wallen, ten miles distant, or by branching to the
left, to descend the Rylvio Pass into Austria.  The
difficulty of dragging the "bob" back made these
distant expeditions events of some rarity, and, indeed, the
first part of the course was so much more exciting
than the roadway, that it was mainly on this portion
that practising for the cup took place.
</p>

<p>
Imagine a track some six feet in width, formed of
snow turned to ice by the process of constant watering,
and so smooth and slippery that a burnished mirror
would be rough and dull in comparison.  Imagine this
track inclined at a steep angle, walled in on both sides
with low ice-banks, and trailing a long and sinuous
course for a length of over a mile!  Here we have the
potentialities of speed when we remember that racing
"bobs" are just low frameworks of wood whose steel
runners glide over the polished track with as little
friction as a flash of lightning traversing a
thunder-cloud.  When we add that the bends of the course are
sharp, and often flanked by sheer precipices, and that
to negotiate these bends at high speed requires the
greatest nerve and skill for all concerned, it is hardly
necessary to add that the sport is one which appeals
to wandering foreigners in search of sensations.
</p>

<p>
"It is a pity you have not got a crew," said Karl
to Saunders, who, with his wife, General Meyer, and
Frau von Bilderbaum, were seated in a wooden shelter
erected at one of the most exciting bends of the course.
"With your skill at the brake and Mrs. Saunders' skill
at the wheel, you would have stood a fine chance of
securing Lady Cobham's trophy."
</p>

<p>
"It is always a pity when politics interfere with
sport," replied Saunders.  "We manage these things
better in England.  When the shooting season
commences politicians take a rest."
</p>

<p>
"Here," said Meyer, "the shooting season commences
when the politicians are most active.  Only we
don't shoot grouse in Grimland&mdash;only kings and
councillors."
</p>

<p>
Karl laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to have seen Saunders take his crew
down the run in approved style," he said; "I'd have
wagered my forest lands to a frost-bite that he'd have
done the best time."
</p>

<p>
"I should have liked nothing better," said Saunders,
"but it is impossible to do oneself credit without
practice.  And I have been busy in other ways: I have
been studying Meyer's treatise on Winter War, and I
am not sure that the possibilities it holds forth are not
more exhilarating even than the competition for Lady
Cobham's cup."
</p>

<p>
"We are likely to have that statement verified, if
what I hear is true," said the Commander-in-Chief
quietly.
</p>

<p>
"And what you hear generally is true," muttered Karl.
</p>

<p>
"In this case I have no doubts," said Meyer.  "A
large military expedition left Weidenbruck the day
before yesterday; its destination and object are not
difficult to surmise."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad," said Frau von Bilderbaum truculently.
"If blows are to be struck, the sooner the
better; we are ready for them."
</p>

<p>
There was a sound of cheering from the direction
of the starting point, signifying that the first crew was
launched on its downward course.
</p>

<p>
It was morning&mdash;10.30 A.M., to be precise&mdash;for the
race had to be run before the sun's power waxed hot
enough to affect the surface of the track.  And the
scene was a gay one: blue and white flags were flying
from poles at every hundred yards of the course, and
from the crowded stands erected at the several points
of vantage.
</p>

<p>
And the day was a typical Weissheim day:
the sky was of a deep and ever-deepening blue.  Not
a breath of air stirred over the snow-veiled face of the
country.  The sun had risen above the shoulder of
the mighty Klauigberg, and had turned the myriad
crystals into a sparkling ocean of unbelievable
whiteness.  To draw breath was to fill one's lungs with
perfect air and one's heart with ecstasy.  To gaze at the
shimmering panorama of towering peaks and snowy
buttresses was to behold the finest view in central
Europe.
</p>

<p>
"Here they come!" ejaculated Karl excitedly, as
a "bob" came into view, accompanied by a slight
scraping sound, as the runners slithered over the
adamantine track.
</p>

<p>
All held their breath, for the speed of the descending
craft was absolutely terrifying.  At the prow was a
goggled figure in a white sweater, with a red dragon&mdash;the
badge of his crew&mdash;worked on his chest.  Behind
him was a young girl, and behind her again four men,
all similarly attired.  With the exception of the
steersman, who crouched forward,&mdash;a tense thing of staring
eyes and straining muscles,&mdash;all were leaning back as
far as possible to minimise wind pressure.
</p>

<p>
"Too fast!" was Saunders' comment.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, in response to a hoarse cry from the steersman,
the crew swung their bodies to the left and
simultaneously flung out their arms in the same direction.
The manœuvre was designed to bring the "bob" round
the corner without checking the pace by applying the
brake.  The result was unsatisfactory.  The prow of
the "bob" struck the counter-bank violently, there was
a gasp from a hundred throats, and a feathery cloud
of snow rose, in which the limbs of half a dozen human
beings were whirling in an intricate and inextricable
confusion.  No one, fortunately, was damaged, and in
a few seconds the crew had sorted themselves and
resumed their chequered career.
</p>

<p>
"Heroism and no brake!" muttered Karl.  "How
like our friend the American!"
</p>

<p>
"May his fall be as harmless!" said Saunders.
</p>

<p>
Frau Bilderbaum snorted.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to see him go over the precipice!"
she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"You probably will&mdash;metaphorically speaking," said
Meyer.  "He is accompanying this expedition against
us, and he has outwitted me twice."
</p>

<p>
A minute later another "bob" was making its
nerve-shattering descent of the lightning run.  This
time its crew,&mdash;a well-drilled sextet in blue jerseys
bearing the facetious badge of a tortoise,&mdash;swept round
the dangerous bend without mishap.
</p>

<p>
"Well done, Miss Reeve-Thompson!" cried Mrs. Saunders,
naming the lady who was steering the
successful craft.
</p>

<p>
"That's done me good," sighed Karl in a note of
satisfaction.  "God's sky and the best of sports!
Clean snow and the champagne air of Weissheim, and
what care I for the rabble of the plains."
</p>

<p>
And so the morning wore on, with cheers for the
skilful, gasps for the rash, and murmurs of pity for
the unfortunate.  There were more spills, of course,
but fortunately no disasters of magnitude, and at
mid-day the great competition was over.  The "times"
were added up and checked, and ultimately Miss
Reeve-Thompson's crew were adjudged the winners, and
accompanied by a cheering throng they received the cup
from Lady Cobham at the Pariserhof.
</p>

<p>
The royal party waited till the crowd of onlookers
had dispersed, and then wended their way back to the
Brunvarad&mdash;the Winter Palace&mdash;on foot.  As they
followed the track that bordered the run they fell in
with General von Bilderbaum, struggling up the hill
in a great grey overcoat, very moist and red of face.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Karl, "how are the new forts looking?"
</p>

<p>
"Very workmanlike, sire.  We have got two new
quick-firers on to the south escarpment of redoubt A,
and some old but serviceable <i>mitraileuses</i> in position in
the long fosse between redoubts C and D."
</p>

<p>
"Excellent," drawled Meyer.  "And our dear, loyal
gunners&mdash;are they continuing to make good practice at
the ice-targets?"
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry for anything they get sight of within
two kilometres," responded the General.
</p>

<p>
"I am well served," said Karl.  "Herr Saunders
here has developed into a student of minor tactics, and
I fancy would handle a brigade as well as a Moltke
or a Kuroki."
</p>

<p>
At this moment they reached the point of the path
where it crosses the bob-sleigh run, and the races being
over and the track closed, a wooden plank had been laid
across the glassy surface to afford secure foothold.
The men halted to allow the ladies,&mdash;Mrs. Saunders and
Frau Generalin von Bilderbaum,&mdash;to pass first.  But
the latter,&mdash;a lady, as the reader knows, of somewhat
egregious proportions,&mdash;was not gifted by nature with
a rapid gait through trampled snow.  Holding high
her green skirt, and planting her cumbrous snow-boots
with deliberate precision, she advanced puffing and
panting like a mountain engine in a snow-drift.
Before, however, she had come up with the others, a
strange man accosted the royal party from the opposite
direction.  The individual in question was wearing skis,
and looked fatigued and travel-stained, as though he
had come fast and far.  A black slouch hat was pressed
over his forehead, and it was not till he was quite close
that Karl and his companions recognised the features
as those of Von Hügelweiler.
</p>

<p>
The Captain's salutation was as abrupt as his appearance.
</p>

<p>
"Hail!  King of half a country," he said.
</p>

<p>
Quietly, swiftly, and without ostentation, Saunders
and Meyer covered the newcomer with their revolvers.
</p>

<p>
"Hands up when you speak to his Majesty," said
the latter.
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler dropped his ski-ing pole and held
up his hands.
</p>

<p>
"I have a weapon in my breast," he said, "but it
is not for any here."
</p>

<p>
Meyer quietly inserted his hand into the Captain's
breast pocket, and drew out a revolver.  It was of the
Grimland army pattern, and loaded in all its chambers.
He swiftly extracted the cartridges and transferred
them to his own person, and then,&mdash;having satisfied
himself that the Captain had no further munitions of
war,&mdash;replaced the unloaded weapon in its original
position.
</p>

<p>
"Now you may talk without the inconvenience of
holding your hands in that fatiguing posture," he said.
"What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"I come from Weidenbruck," said Von Hügelweiler,
"and I bring news.  The day before yesterday an
expedition left the capital for Weissheim."
</p>

<p>
Meyer nodded.
</p>

<p>
"That is so," he agreed; "we get to know things,
even in this charmingly remote district.  Still, details
are always agreeable.  What does the force consist of?"
</p>

<p>
"The whole brigade of Guards, two battalions of
Guides, and the Kurdeburg Sharpshooters."
</p>

<p>
"They do me honour," said the King.  "But they
will find the railway somewhat disorganised.  You see,
we have dynamited the principal viaducts, to say
nothing of the two-mile tunnel under the Kahberg&mdash;and
these things are not easy to repair when the snow is
down."
</p>

<p>
"The railway is open as far as Eselbruck," the
Captain returned, "and from thence they will come over
the passes on skis.  They will come quicker than they
would in the summer."
</p>

<p>
"That is true enough," agreed Meyer.  "And who
is in command of this imposing force?"
</p>

<p>
"Bernhardt."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!  And the second in command?"
</p>

<p>
"A cursed American."
</p>

<p>
Meyer smiled.
</p>

<p>
"That describes Herr Trafford admirably," he said.
"But how about yourself, Von Hügelweiler?  How is
it you are not occupying a distinguished position in
this amiable field-force?"
</p>

<p>
"Because there are limits even to my dishonour,"
retorted Von Hügelweiler fiercely.  "In transferring
my services from his Majesty King Karl to her
Majesty Queen Gloria, I knew I was sinking, but I
only learned a little while ago to what great depths."
</p>

<p>
"You are the man who was sent to hold the Strafeburg
for me," said Karl sternly, "and who handed it
over to the mob rather than risk your skin."
</p>

<p>
"I did not yield to fear," retorted the Captain,
turning almost savagely on his sovereign.  "I yielded to
an even more odious thing&mdash;passion.  The Princess
pleaded with me, balancing her woman's grace against
my loyalty.  I could face the fury of the multitude,
but I succumbed to the blandishments of a wanton!"
</p>

<p>
The word drew an exclamation of surprise and
indignation from Saunders.
</p>

<p>
"And you had your reward!" he said with a sneer.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, I have had my reward," was the bitter
answer.  "Love such as mine always has its reward.  I
learned who it was upon whom the fickle Gloria had
bestowed her worthless heart.  Who was it, do you
think?  A nobleman, a great soldier, a Prince?  No!
She was conducting a guilty intrigue with the
schweinhund Trafford&mdash;the man who betrayed his party
by immuring the enemy in a spikeless <i>Eisenmädchen</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's true enough," said Karl.  "The
schweinhund Trafford, as you call him, possesses some
rudimentary ideas of humanity, despite his absurd
predilection for anarchy.  I may remember that when
my time comes."
</p>

<p>
"It was an act of folly and weakness," said the
Captain recklessly, "an act of treachery to the side he
had espoused.  As soon as I heard of it I hastened to
Bernhardt's chambers with the news."
</p>

<p>
"And he said?" asked Karl.
</p>

<p>
"He said he loved and hated you," replied the
Captain.
</p>

<p>
Karl nodded thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"I believe that expresses his mental attitude towards
me very well," he said.
</p>

<p>
"It was the mad paradox of an <i>absintheur</i>," Von
Hügelweiler interrupted.  "He was half drunk and
wholly dangerous, and I left him.  I roused the people
against Trafford, but the scoundrel defended himself
cunningly, and in the end the devil-ridden Bernhardt
turned up and rescued him with a troop of Dragoons."
</p>

<p>
"And why are you here?" asked General Bilderbaum.
</p>

<p>
"For one thing, there are two hundred kronen on my
head in Weidenbruck," replied Von Hügelweiler.
"That makes the place unhealthy.  Neither do I desire
to serve that delightful trinity, the wanton Queen,
the dipsomaniac priest, and the <i>verdomte</i> American."
</p>

<p>
"But why come here?" persisted Bilderbaum, growing,
if possible, still redder in the face.
</p>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler ignored the speaker, and turned to
Karl.
</p>

<p>
"I have no claim on your trust," he said to his late
sovereign, "no claim on your mercy&mdash;but my services
may be useful.  I ask no high command, I merely
crave to be put somewhere in the firing-line, where I
can put a bullet into the heart of the cursed American."
</p>

<p>
A silence followed this savage request.  Then Karl
turned to General Bilderbaum.
</p>

<p>
"What say you, General?" he asked.  "Do you
like the look of your new recruit?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sire," said the old soldier bluntly.  "I have
some blackguards in my command, but no double-dyed
traitor such as this."
</p>

<p>
"What!"  Von Hügelweiler's nerves,&mdash;never well
under control,&mdash;were raw and ragged from his recent
bitter experience, and by no means improved by the
forced and hasty journey he had undertaken to
Weissheim.  With a cry of rage and indignation he swung
round on the plain-spoken old General, maddened at
the insult, and raising his fist as though to avenge it
with a blow.  But, as on a previous occasion, the
General's wife was near at hand to protect the sacred
person of her lord and master.  Boiling with indignation,
she hurled her ample person at the mutinous captain.
Von Hügelweiler gave ground&mdash;he would have
been a Samson had he not done so.  And he stepped,
not on to the snow, not on to the plank that crossed
the run, but on to the surface of the bob-sleigh track
itself.  He might have trodden on a cloud or a
trembling bog for all the foothold it afforded, and with
a cry he fell, the Frau von Bilderbaum falling heavily
and incontinently on him.  Hands were stretched out,
but too late.  Before the General could clutch the
skirt of his devoted partner, the ill-assorted
pair,&mdash;struggling, writhing, uttering noises of wrath and
fear,&mdash;had commenced the descent of the "bob" run.
Nothing could stop their downward progress.  Swifter
and swifter the terrified twain glided, impotent hands
clutched at the frictionless banks, and impotent heels
were pressed fiercely and fruitlessly on to the glassy
surface of the track.  Down they went, the Captain
struggling and swearing, the woman struggling and
bellowing.  The pace grew.  They became disengaged.
Von Hügelweiler slithered swiftly on his side, Frau von
Bilderbaum rotated slowly in a sitting posture, descending
with ever-growing momentum.  Up a banked curve
she swung, fat arms were raised frantically, a roar
of pathetic discomfort shook the frosty air, and the
devoted woman disappeared from view round a bend
of the track.
</p>

<p>
Much of the colour had left General Bilderbaum's
face.  No one laughed, for the ludicrous mishap might
well be a prelude to a serious, even fatal, accident.
Saunders climbed up a high mound of piled snow, from
which the further bends of the track might be visible.
</p>

<p>
"There are some men at work lower down sweeping
the course," he said, speaking clearly for all to hear.
"They have heard the cries and they are preparing
to stop them.  Two have put their brooms across the
track&mdash;but the speed is gathering.  They have stopped
her&mdash;no! the impetus was too great&mdash;the sweepers are
rolling backwards in the snow.  Wait! the pace is
checked&mdash;others are helping.  They've got her.  Now&mdash;ah!
Hügelweiler's on the top of them!  What a collision!
She's up, unhurt!  It's all right, General; your
good lady is safe and sound of limb.  She's had a
shaking, but her nerves are good, or I'm no judge of
physiology.  Go down and look after her."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, and after Hügelweiler, too," spluttered the
veteran.  "I've a heavy reckoning with that young
scoundrel that will take some paying, or I'm not the
son of Karl Bilderbaum the Fierce."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder,"&mdash;said Karl, as soon as General Bilderbaum
had left to recover his hapless spouse,&mdash;"I wonder
whether this man Von Hügelweiler might not prove
a valuable addition to our force.  He seems to have the
enemy's discomfiture, if not our interests, very much at
heart."
</p>

<p>
"Where would you put him?" asked Saunders.
</p>

<p>
"I should put him where David put Uriah the Hittite,"
said Meyer.  "Where he has himself asked to
be put&mdash;in the firing line."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
<br><br>
RIVAL INFLUENCES
</h3>

<p>
Von Hügelweiler had spoken true when he said that
the expedition had started against Weissheim.  Two
days after Trafford had so narrowly escaped the
violence of the Weidenbruck mob the various regiments
were entrained at the great terminus in the
Bahnhofstrasse.  The sight of men being despatched to kill
their fellow-men always rouses enthusiasm in the human
breast, and there was abundance of flaunting banners,
martial melody, and sounding cheers from the
stay-at-homes.  And in the rolling of drums and the
reverberation of cheers Gloria herself seemed to have
forgotten her original prejudice against the campaign.  And
as the engine screeched and the royal train, decked with
the green and yellow bunting of her House, moved
slowly from the station, she felt a Queen going forth
to re-conquer a rebellious province, a just instrument
of picturesque vengeance, rather than the player of the
unwelcome role of blood-guilty adventuress.  She put
her head out of the window, and bowed and smiled and
waved her hand, a thing of girlish excitement with the
minutest appreciation of the underlying grimness of
the situation.
</p>

<p>
That day they steamed to Eselbruck.  At this point
the railway was cut.  The great stone viaduct that
spanned the deep ravine was a thing of shattered piers
and broken arches, an interesting problem for the
engineer, and an object-lesson in the effective use of
detonating cartridges.  At this point, therefore, the units
were derailed, a depôt formed, and on the next morning
the whole force,&mdash;shod with skis and in full marching
order,&mdash;set itself in motion towards Weissheim.
During the march Trafford neither saw nor heard from
Gloria.  He was not unhappy.  The fine air, the healthy
exercise, the splendid uplands through which they were
passing, won him to a mood of strong content.  Something
had lit a fire in his heart that no wind of disfavour
or adversity could extinguish.  He knew that
he was a living man again, moving among creatures of
flesh and blood; not a spiritless mechanism in a world
of automata.  He had seen, or fancied he had seen, a
spark of human love in the young Queen's heart, and
that spark he swore to kindle into flame by deeds of
reckless heroism.  And the great energy that was his
birthright,&mdash;stimulated to its highest capacity by the
bracing air of the snow-clad passes and the extraordinary
beauty of the land,&mdash;filled his spirit with a vast
and comforting hopefulness.
</p>

<p>
In the course of the afternoon he found Bernhardt
by his side.  Trafford began to thank him for his
rescue from the mob, but Bernhardt interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
"I know about your secret marriage," he said, "and
though I think it folly, it is the sort of folly I admire.
Von Hügelweiler told me about it.  To the people he
told another story,&mdash;a less respectable story without
ring or sacrament."
</p>

<p>
"So I gather.  But I can fight calumny as I can
fight other enemies of my Queen."
</p>

<p>
Bernhardt nodded approvingly.
</p>

<p>
"They breed men in your country," he said, and then
asked: "Are you tired?"
</p>

<p>
"It is impossible to be tired in such air," was the
reply.
</p>

<p>
"Ski-running is a new sport to you, and you are in
love."
</p>

<p>
Trafford laughed lightly.
</p>

<p>
"I am in love with Grimland," he said.  "Weidenbruck
is a villainous place; but these gorgeous mountains,
with their great, sombre forests and limitless
snow-fields, make up a picture I shall never forget.  I
should like to be king of such a country."
</p>

<p>
"One never knows," said Bernhardt.  "A great and
striking victory, and your dream may be realised.  But
for the present, remember that you are a soldier, not
a consort.  Our friend Von Hügelweiler has an evil
tongue, and he has spread cruel slanders about you
and the Queen.  Evil things win quick credence in
Grimland, and the only way to give them the lie is for
you and Gloria to see nothing of each other at present."
</p>

<p>
"That is a little rough on a newly-married man."
</p>

<p>
"Your marriage is nothing.  The Grimlander, who
is fickleness personified,&mdash;and who would like a change
of dynasty once a week,&mdash;is never a Republican.  He
would not tolerate the idea of his sovereign mating with
a commoner.  The only possible chance of such a step
being accepted is for you to do something quite out
of the ordinary in this campaign.  It will hardly be
wise even then&mdash;but we might chance it."
</p>

<p>
"I believe in fate," said Trafford stubbornly.
</p>

<p>
"Comfort yourself your own way," said Bernhardt.
"I, for my part, wish you well.  There is a dash of
the devil about you that wins my best wishes.  But I
have no further time to waste discussing your affairs.
I am wanted here, there, and everywhere, and the time
is one of war, not of love.  Only, remember my command,
my advice if you prefer it; keep your mind fixed
on your military duties, and avoid her gracious
Majesty Gloria as you would the plague."
</p>

<p>
That night they encamped at Schafers-stadt&mdash;a
quaint old town lying in a sunless valley between
precipitous hills.  Next day they started early, reaching
Wallen, a mountain village within easy striking
distance of Weissheim, shortly after sunset.  Here
accommodation was somehow found for the considerable force
under Bernhardt's command.  Shelter had to be
obtained for all, for to sleep out of doors at such an
altitude during the winter months meant awakening in
another world.  Food had also to be provided on a
large scale, for the force was what is called a "flying
column"; that is to say, it was proceeding across
country in the most direct line to its objective, and
not relying on road or railway for a continuance of
supplies.
</p>

<p>
The only transport accompanying the force was of
a grimmer nature.  A number of pieces of ordnance
were being conveyed on flat-bottomed sleighs, specially
constructed for the purpose.  And these had to be
drawn, with infinite labour, by men on skis, for the way
lay over a countryside many feet deep in snow, and
horses would have been absolutely useless for such a
purpose.  Trafford, therefore, was busy on his arrival
unearthing cheeses and loaves, wine-casks and other
fascinating objects, from the cellars of the more or less
hospitable Walleners.  Whilst so employed he was,
approached by a private of the Guards with a note.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>Come to the big house in the Market Square&mdash;the
one with the carved escutcheon over the door&mdash;at
6.30, and I will give you dinner.&mdash;Gloria R.</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I will write an answer," said Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"There is no answer, Excellency," said the man, and
with a salute he was gone.
</p>

<p>
Trafford rubbed his hand thoughtfully up and down
the back of his neck.  Bernhardt had been quite
definite in his command to him not to see the Queen, and
though the order was little to his liking, he approved
its prudence.  But the letter in his hand was also a
command, and it came from a higher source than even
Bernhardt's dictum.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, at half-past six he presented himself
at a big balconied house in the Market Square.  A
simple meal was spread for two in the dining-room,&mdash;a
low pitched apartment panelled from floor to ceiling
in dark pine, and garnished with a wealth of cumbrous,
antique furniture.
</p>

<p>
He waited alone for a few moments, cheered by a
most appetising and savoury odour of cooking, and
then Gloria entered, smiling, cordial, eminently composed.
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad you have come," she began.
</p>

<p>
He took her outstretched hand and kissed it.
</p>

<p>
"I am a soldier, and I obey," he said.
</p>

<p>
"When it pleases you," she laughed.  "And I hope
it does please you to dine tête-à-tête with me."
</p>

<p>
"I can conceive no greater felicity."
</p>

<p>
"None?"
</p>

<p>
"None," he answered.  "I have the excitement of
a military campaign, my eyes are continually feasted
with magnificent scenery, and my lungs with matchless
air.  Then, on the top of a day of most exhilarating
exercise comes an invitation from the lady who is my
wife on paper, and whom I have sworn to make my
wife in the sight of all men."
</p>

<p>
Gloria looked him fully in the face and pressed a
small hand-bell that reposed on the table at her side.
</p>

<p>
"Gaspar," she said to the orderly who had entered,
"bring in the dinner.  You know that our friend
Bernhardt has forbidden us to meet," Gloria continued,
after a dish of <i>yungfernbraten</i>&mdash;roast pork and juniper
berries&mdash;had been set before them.
</p>

<p>
"I know," said Trafford, "and he was right."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
Trafford hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Von Hügelweiler seems to have coupled our names
in an unpleasant manner," he said at length.
</p>

<p>
Gloria flushed.
</p>

<p>
"Then you should not have come," she said.
</p>

<p>
"You gave me no option.  As your husband I might
have refused.  As your officer I had to obey."
</p>

<p>
"You might have exercised your discretion."
</p>

<p>
"I might if I had any," he replied.  "But I am a
most indiscreet man.  To-morrow, so I understand, I
am going into action.  I may win fame or I may be
shot through the head.  As the latter alternative is
not unlikely, I am anxious to spend what may be
my last evening on earth with the one woman whom I
really&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A forcible ring from Gloria interrupted the sentence's
conclusion.
</p>

<p>
"Gaspar, fill this gentleman's glass.  As you were
remarking, Captain, Grimland is a very beautiful
country."
</p>

<p>
"It is a very cold country," Trafford growled,
plunging his fork into the steaming viands.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow night I shall be sleeping in my ancestral
home&mdash;the Marienkastel," Gloria pursued, as the
orderly withdrew.  "It is a fine old place, and Karl
forfeited it when my father failed to carry out his
projects in 1904."
</p>

<p>
"That is the place you wish me to win back for you?"
</p>

<p>
"If you will be so kind?"
</p>

<p>
"And suppose I am killed in the process, will you
think kindly of me?"
</p>

<p>
"Very."
</p>

<p>
The callousness of the affirmation horrified him.
</p>

<p>
"I believe you were right when you said you had no
heart!" he cried indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"That is what I want you to believe," she returned
calmly.
</p>

<p>
"And that if I am killed," he went on bitterly,
"you will welcome the termination of an impossible
situation."
</p>

<p>
Gloria gave an almost imperceptible shrug.
</p>

<p>
"You keep harping on death," she protested,
"surely you are not afraid?"
</p>

<p>
He turned fiercely on her, but restrained his voice to
a level tone.
</p>

<p>
"From what you know of me," he asked, "am I
the sort of man who is likely to be afraid?"
</p>

<p>
"No," she admitted readily.  "The night of the
revolution you were heroism personified.  Also I have
heard of your exploit in Herr Krantz's wine-shop, and
it&mdash;it sounded very typical of you."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," he said, meeting her gaze; and an
instant later, he added: "There is no such thing as
fear in the world for me."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
He answered her question with a reckless bang on
the table.
</p>

<p>
"Because I have lived!" he cried.  "If a bullet finds
its way to my heart it will have warm lodging.  I am
a happy man, and my happiness stands high above the
accidents of life and death.  Eternity has no terrors
but solitude, and for me there will never be such a thing
as solitude again, because I have met my second self."
</p>

<p>
A hand was stretched out towards the bell, but Trafford
intercepted it, and the bell was swept off the table
on to the floor.
</p>

<p>
Gloria rose with flashing eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I asked you here in a spirit of camaraderie," she
said haughtily.  "Because I owe much to you and
am conscious of the debt, I risked angering Bernhardt
and smirching my own fair name.  But you abuse my
confidence.  You know, as I know, that the present is
no time for love-making.  And yet&mdash;&mdash;"  She stopped
abruptly, for Trafford had risen, and, picking up the
bell, he put it on the table before her.
</p>

<p>
"Ring," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Can I not trust you?"
</p>

<p>
"No!" he retorted.  "You gave me the right to
love you, not by your promise to go through the ceremony
of marriage with me, not by the fulfilment of that
promise, but by a certain light that shone in your eyes
for a few brief seconds in the chapel of the Neptunburg.
I am exercising that right to-night."
</p>

<p>
She drew in her breath sharply.
</p>

<p>
"You said just now that I was heartless," she said.
</p>

<p>
"That is the usual lover's lie," he retorted; "the
reproach that is only justified by its manifest untruth.
But I am a gentleman, as you vaguely surmise, and
I will not persist in an attention which is unwelcome
to you.  I came to make an appeal.  You have but to
command, and I will leave without another word."
</p>

<p>
"What is the appeal?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you wish me to make it?" he countered.
</p>

<p>
"You have said so much you had best go on."
</p>

<p>
Trafford drew back the curtain of the mullioned
window and gazed at the shining pageantry of the
frosty skies.  For a full minute he stood gazing, and
then he dropped the tapestry and faced his royal
hostess.
</p>

<p>
"I said I was content with things as they are," he
began, "and to a point that is so, for they are better
than they might have been.  But with the eye of faith
I see something nobler than this struggle for a
kingdom we have no right to possess.  Something has made
me wise these past few days: something has taught me
that the love of excitement can be very cruel, and
that the harrying of a brave man is not necessarily a
more elevating sport than bull-baiting."
</p>

<p>
"You wish me to abandon this expedition against Karl?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is an absurd, impossible demand, I know,"
he said, "and I don't ask you for a moment to
consider it.  There are a hundred reasons why we should
go on, and there is only one reason why we should
not; and that reason does not seem to weigh with you
at all.  But I am a madman, a visionary, and, like
Bernhardt, I see things.  And in my hallucinations I see a
woman who is Queen, not of Grimland, but of an even
more delectable country.  And the woman I see has
but one subject, and she is content with him alone,
because her sway over him is so paramount."
</p>

<p>
Gloria stood very, very still.  Only her fingers
moved as they plucked the fur trimming of her
dress.
</p>

<p>
"If I asked you to give up Grimland and fly with
me to America, would you do it?" he cried passionately.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;but I should like to hear you ask it."  A
smile, the slowest smile that ever was, bent the extreme
corners of the fascinating lips, and ultimately broke
in a burst of sunshine illuminating the whole face.  Its
arrival found him by her side, his hand on her arm,
and a look in his eyes that sought for something with
an almost pathetic intensity.
</p>

<p>
"I do ask you to come to America with me," he
said.  "Will you come&mdash;come to New York, the great,
bright city, where the people do not do the horrible
things they do in Grimland and other out-of-the-way
corners of Europe?"  He waited a moment, and then
added: "Of course, we shall always keep this beautiful
country in our hearts&mdash;a land of rocky spires and
splintered crags, a land of swelling snow-fields and
amazingly blue skies; a land where the air is sweet and
keen and pine-laden, and the face of Nature stands bold
and true, crisp-cut from the chisel of the Master-mason."
</p>

<p>
There was no answer.  His hand trembled on her arm
like a vibrant note of interrogation; his eyes strained
to catch the light he longed for, the light he had seen,
or fancied he had seen, in the gloom of the Chapel
Royal.
</p>

<p>
"Will you come?" he breathed; and for a pregnant
second the world of things material rolled back from
his consciousness, and left him standing alone in space
with his fate.  For the strange brain was playing
tricks with him,&mdash;as big, uncontrolled brains do with
impulsive, ill-balanced people.  His five senses were in
abeyance, or warped beyond all present usefulness.  He
saw a pair of eyes as points of light in a world of
darkness, but all sense of reality had utterly deserted
him.  He was as he had been in the Chapel Royal
when his bride had made her hesitating avowal of a
half-passion.  A sheet of flame seemed to be passing
through his body, a roseate glow suffused his vision;
he never realised that he was uttering a beloved name
in a voice of thunder and grasping a beloved object
with no little strength.  But ecstatic entrancements,
however subliminal, yield ultimately to rude physical
shocks, and dimly and slowly the world of dreams
vanished and he became conscious that someone was hitting
him violently on the back.  Turning round with half-dazed
eyes, he found himself confronted with the stern
lineaments of Father Bernhardt.  The ex-priest, clad
in a military overcoat and high leggings, and powdered
with still unmelted snow, carried mingled wrath and
astonishment in his countenance.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sunde und Siechheit!</i>" he cried.  "Are you, too,
an <i>absintheur</i>, Captain Trafford?"
</p>

<p>
For the moment Trafford had not the vaguest idea
what an <i>absintheur</i> might be, but he replied vaguely
in the negative.
</p>

<p>
Bernhardt uttered an oath.
</p>

<p>
"I called you three times by name," he said, "and
I struck you three times on the back before you would
condescend to pay me any attention."
</p>

<p>
"I apologise," said Trafford; "I was thinking of
other things."
</p>

<p>
"You were in a delirium," retorted Bernhardt.
"The fiend of Tobit&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hang the fiend of Tobit!" interrupted Trafford
hotly.  "I may be a lunatic, Bernhardt, but I'm
a healthy-minded lunatic, if there is such a thing.  I
was making love, and we'll leave it at that, if you
please, and drop all talk of delirium and fiends."
</p>

<p>
"I was finding an excuse for you."
</p>

<p>
"I don't need one, thank you."  Trafford, as is the
way with interrupted lovers, was in an irritable mood,
and being so did not notice that Bernhardt was really
angry.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed you do!" retorted the ex-priest.  "I forbade
you expressly to see the Queen, and I find you
dining alone with her, and making violent love to her
in addition."
</p>

<p>
"I received a command to dine."
</p>

<p>
"And a command to make love?" sneered Bernhardt.
</p>

<p>
"That is my affair."
</p>

<p>
Bernhardt turned from the irate American to the
confused Gloria, and there was little deference in his
regard.
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty does not value your reputation too
highly," he said.  "As long as you play at being a
maid it is as well to act like a maid."
</p>

<p>
"My reputation can look after itself," she retorted
with dignity.
</p>

<p>
"We are five thousand feet above sea level," put in
Trafford, "and at least two thousand above the level
of perpetual convention.  What was a wise precaution
at Weidenbruck becomes sheer timidity at Wallen.
But if you still think my presence is infectious to the
Queen's honour, I will withdraw.  The question I came
to ask has been answered, and answered well."
</p>

<p>
Bernhardt turned a pair of piercing eyes on the
intrepid American.  Trafford met the look without
flinching.
</p>

<p>
"You are a very strange person, Herr Trafford,"
said the ex-priest slowly; "you are not afraid of me.
I believe you and Saunders are the only two men in
Grimland who are capable of standing up to me in
my wrath.  But tell me before you go, what was this
question you put and what was its answer."
</p>

<p>
"I asked her Majesty if she wished to continue this
expedition against Karl, and she answered, 'No.'"
</p>

<p>
"She answered 'No!'" Bernhardt gasped.
</p>

<p>
"If you do not believe me, ask her yourself."
</p>

<p>
Again Bernhardt turned to the young Queen.
</p>

<p>
"Is it true?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
Gloria passed her hand across her forehead, as if she
was just recovering from a condition of unconsciousness.
When she spoke it was in jerky, consequent sentences.
</p>

<p>
"Karl is a brave man; he is not a bad man.  It is
cruel to harry people&mdash;loyal, brave people.  He is the
lawful sovereign of Grimland.  I don't wish to cause
suffering.  I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There speaks a Schattenberg!" interrupted Bernhardt
with a mocking laugh.  "The man who killed
your father is entrenched within two leagues of you.
Your house, the historic Marienkastel, home of the
Schattenbergs for centuries, is his appanage.  You
have six thousand men at your back to win you back
your heritage; but the old, heroic fire is burning low,
the fierce old blood is running thin&mdash;the Schattenbergs
are bred out!"
</p>

<p>
The man's calculated scorn, his splendid insolence,
filled Trafford with admiration; and it was plain that
his caustic speech was not without its effect on the
sensitive Gloria.  She seemed to be emerging from a
stupor which still drugged her senses.
</p>

<p>
"I would like the Marienkastel," she conceded; "it
is the home of my childhood; its walls are very dear
to me.  It should be mine by right."
</p>

<p>
"Say rather by might," retorted Bernhardt.  "You
like the Marienkastel, but you do not like the withering
fire that decimates the storming party.  Its walls
are dear to you, but the forlorn hope, the scaling
ladders, and the petard are abhorrent to your soul.  You
wish to possess, but the strong man armed is too
forbidding a person to be ousted."
</p>

<p>
"If the expedition were against the Marienkastel&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It is against the Marienkastel," interrupted
Bernhardt.  "The Marienkastel is the key to the whole
town.  If we can hold it for half an hour we can
dictate what terms we like."
</p>

<p>
"Dictate what terms we like!" Gloria repeated the
last words of his sentence with eyes aflame.  She was
a Schattenberg again, ardent, ambitious, reckless.  All
trace of weakness had left her.
</p>

<p>
"And can we take it&mdash;can we hold it?" she went
on in tones of eager inquiry.
</p>

<p>
Bernhardt stretched out his hand towards Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"There is the answer to your question," he said.
</p>

<p>
"You will capture the Marienkastel for me?" she
asked, turning to her silent lover.
</p>

<p>
Trafford looked at the girl before him long and
searchingly before answering.
</p>

<p>
"The Marienkastel is the key to Weissheim," he
said at length; "it is also, it appears, the key to your
heart.  I thought there was a nearer way,&mdash;a better
way.  Yes," he went on, "I will capture the
Marienkastel, or do all that a man can do to capture it,
and then I will claim my reward."
</p>

<p>
"You shall have it," said Bernhardt; "I swear it."
</p>

<p>
"And I promise..." breathed Gloria.
</p>

<p>
Trafford nodded to himself.
</p>

<p>
"I am content," he said.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
<br><br>
THE OPENING BARS
</h3>

<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Saunders were having breakfast
together in the pretty stone villa they had built for
themselves at Weissheim, overlooking the Nonnensee.
The view of the mountains beyond the lake, the exquisite
expanse of snow, growing into sparkling life under
the touch of the rising sun, furnished a prospect of
sufficiently absorbing grandeur.  But Saunders' eyes
wandered only from an <i>omelette aux fines herbes</i> to a
belated copy of the <i>Morning Post</i>.  English newspapers
had been scarce since the cutting of the railway, and
the present specimen had reached its destination by a
roundabout way through Vienna, and had cost exactly
tenpence.
</p>

<p>
"What is the Government doing?" asked Mrs. Saunders,
who took an interest in home politics.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  When I am in this delightfully
disorganised country the mild animosities of English
party strife fill me with contempt.  I was reading the
'Births, deaths, and marriages' just to prove to
myself that there are natural tragedies and romances, even
in the decently regulated areas of Bayswater and Mayfair."
</p>

<p>
"Is anyone we know mentioned?"
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" ejaculated Saunders after a pause.
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!"
</p>

<p>
"Please go on, Robert," said Mrs. Saunders with
pardonable impatience.
</p>

<p>
"Angela Knox, that American girl, is&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Is going to marry a grouse moor."
</p>

<p>
"Pray be explicit."
</p>

<p>
"Glengourlie&mdash;a little man in the Scots Guards.
Eldest son of the Marquis of Stratheerie; ten thousand
a year and the best half of Inverness-shire."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Saunders received this startling information
with composure.
</p>

<p>
"She'll make a handsome peeress," was her comment.
</p>

<p>
"What about George Trafford?" asked her husband.
</p>

<p>
"Grimland is a country of short memories and swift
changes," said Mrs. Saunders.  "It converted you
from a <i>blasé</i> bachelor to a happy husband; and it has
converted George Trafford from a broken-hearted
desperado to a lover of an usurping queen."
</p>

<p>
"Do you believe Von Hügelweiler's tale?" asked
Saunders in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and no; I believe George has undoubtedly
been fascinated by Gloria.  With her beauty, high
spirit, and fearless temperament, she was bound to
attract him.  Fresh from a recent disappointment&mdash;and
lacking as he is at all times in all sense of
proportion&mdash;he is quite capable of demanding her hand in
marriage.  But Gloria,&mdash;though she would like him
well enough as a friend,&mdash;would not dream of stultifying
herself by marrying a plain American; still less
would she stoop to the depths Von Hügelweiler hinted
at."
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry about it all," said Saunders.  "Nervy,
with all his faults, is a lovable sort of scoundrel, and
he had a pretty severe knock over <i>l'affaire Angela</i>.  If
Gloria is fooling him for her own purposes&mdash;as seems
more than certain&mdash;it will leave him, spiritually and
mentally, in a condition of pulp."
</p>

<p>
"You mean&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, not exactly; for one thing, he's mad already.
He's like a man on a free-wheel bicycle without a
brake&mdash;all right on the level, but in the deuce of a
fix if he begins to go downhill."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Saunders looked thoughtful.
</p>

<p>
"There is a possibility that he may never live to
be disillusioned," she said.  "He is said to be
accompanying this force against us, and he is not the sort
of person to cultivate the art of taking cover.  However,
things will be settled one way or the other soon."
</p>

<p>
"Very soon," Saunders agreed.  "Meyer's scouts
report that the enemy encamped last night at Wallen;
and they don't waste time there.  Six thousand
able-bodied men in a bracing climate eat a good
deal&mdash;and Wallen is a small place with a limited supply of
hams and maize.  They will be here to-day or to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Saunders devoted her attention to the omelette
which furnished their morning meal.  She was a lady
who had made a point of hiding her emotions, and the
near prospect of her husband being in danger
necessitated a strong effort of control.  It was some minutes
before she spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do this morning?" she
asked at length.  "I should 'curl,' if I were you.
You haven't 'sent down' a 'stone' for weeks, and I
think a respite from your military preoccupations
would do you good."
</p>

<p>
Saunders sighed regretfully, and stretched himself.
</p>

<p>
"There is a competition to-day," he replied;
"Major Flannel's Cup, and I am not in for it.  I may
watch for a bit, but things are too critical now to
admit of much leisure.  You see, I've been told off to
hold the Marienkastel, and our good friends the enemy
may send us their visiting-cards at any minute."
</p>

<p>
"And can you hold the Marienkastel?" asked Mrs. Saunders.
</p>

<p>
Saunders smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I can hold it for a couple of hours," he replied,
"which is all that Meyer requires of me.  We are to
put as many of the enemy out of action as we can,
and then yield possession with a bad grace.  After that
we have a little surprise for them: a couple of
concealed mortars, which will blow the historic old fabric
and those inside it into several thousand fragments."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Saunders suppressed a shudder.
</p>

<p>
"And are they sure to attack the Marienkastel?"
she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely certain," he replied, "if they know the
rudiments of military science.  Besides, there are
sentimental reasons for their doing so, for the old Schloss
is the ancestral home of the Schattenbergs."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Saunders was silent for a moment; then she
spoke, hesitatingly, but with a forced calm.
</p>

<p>
"And will your position&mdash;be a very dangerous
one?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Fairly so," he replied lightly.  "You see, we shall
have to bear the brunt of the main attack, and we
shall hang on as long as we can.  But it is in the
evacuation that we shall probably lose most heavily."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Saunders nodded sagely.
</p>

<p>
"And it is in the subsequent bombardment that the
enemy will suffer most severely?" she inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Precisely.  It will mean turning the fine old place
into a shambles, but we must strike hard or not at all;
and Karl's blood is up, as it was in 1904."
</p>

<p>
A deep, vibrant "boom" broke on their ears, and
died with long-drawn echoes amid the encircling
mountains.
</p>

<p>
"The enemy have sent their visiting-card!" said
Mrs. Saunders.
</p>

<p>
Saunders rose, and stepped hurriedly out of the long
window on to the balcony, his wife following.  The
former produced a pair of field-glasses, and critically
regarded a puff of smoke that hung motionless in the
still morning air to the extreme left of the panorama.
</p>

<p>
"Four-inch Creusot," he said laconically; "that
means that redoubt A has found something to practise
at&mdash;a feint attack, probably.  I must go to my post
in the Marienkastel.  They'll have worked round there
in a couple of hours, and then the serious business will
begin."
</p>

<p>
Another sounding roar came pealing along the hillsides,
and then a veritable concert, as the other iron
mouths took up the harsh music and shook the thin
air with their stern melody.
</p>

<p>
From where they stood the actual operations of the
attack were invisible by reason of the pine woods that
clothed the plain in that direction.  But there was
much to see from the commanding site occupied by the
Saunders' villa.  The town itself,&mdash;with its circle of
improvised forts,&mdash;lay considerably below them to the
left.  Companies of soldiers were plainly discernible
defiling to the various points of defence assigned to them,
and the blare of bugles rang shrilly through the
strident chorus of the distant cannon.  It was plain that
the greatest activity prevailed, but an activity
well-ordered, thought-out, and purposeful.
</p>

<p>
Meyer,&mdash;with all his unsoldierly distaste for personal
danger,&mdash;was almost perfect as the general of a
threatened city.  Every detail had been thought out, every
unit of the defence was ready at a moment's notice to
take his appointed place.
</p>

<p>
Saunders turned his sweeping gaze to the right, and
it lighted upon the private curling-rink belonging to
Major Flannel's villa.  He smiled, for the contest for
the Flannel Cup had already begun, and was going on
heedless of the stern symphony that was making the
valleys echo with bursts of shattering sound.
</p>

<p>
A curling competition demands a whole-hearted
absorption from its votaries, and takes little heed of
battle, murder, and sudden death, provided the ice is
keen and in good order.
</p>

<p>
"What are you smiling at?" demanded Mrs. Saunders.
</p>

<p>
"British sense of proportion," he replied, and as
he spoke a man on skis approached from the street
below and called on him by name.
</p>

<p>
"Orders from the General, Excellency!"
</p>

<p>
Saunders took the note.  It was a hurried scrawl in
Meyer's handwriting:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Proceed instantly on receipt of this to the
Marienkastel.  Hang on till they get within a hundred yards,
then bolt for the abatis in the new cemetery!</i>"  Saunders
read it aloud, and then turned to his wife.
</p>

<p>
"Farewell, dearest," he said simply.  "When I
have gone make your way to the Pariserhof.  You
will be perfectly safe there."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Saunders hung speechless a moment in her
husband's embrace.  When she spoke it was apologetically,
as one demanding a difficult favour.
</p>

<p>
"Robert," she pleaded, "should I be a great nuisance
in the Marienkastel?  I could tend the wounded&mdash;I
might even&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To-day is a day of obedience and discipline," he
interrupted with firm kindness.  "I am ordered to the
Marienkastel, you to the Pariserhof.  Yours is the post
of anxiety, mine of excitement.  Man is selfish and
woman patient&mdash;and so the latter always has to bear
the crueller burden."
</p>

<p>
She bit her lip and nodded, and released herself from
his embrace.  Strong arms handed him his rifle, and
cool, steady hands fastened the cartridge-belt around
his waist.
</p>

<p>
"You know Karl entreated you not to take part in
this stupid war," she said with the suspicion of a break
in her voice.  "Was it kind to me to refuse him?"
</p>

<p>
"It was infernally cruel," he replied.  "Necessity
generally is."
</p>

<p>
Again she nodded thoughtfully.  He was right; he
was bound to help Karl, but it needed a brave woman
to admit the necessity.  But Mrs. Saunders was no
ordinary woman, and for a minute her hazel eyes fought
hard and not unsuccessfully against the hot, pent
stream that battled for an exit.  For a moment she
fought the unequal fight; then nature gained the day.
</p>

<p>
The tears won through, and the strong, supple form
became a clinging thing of naked grief.
</p>

<p>
Saunders pressed the bowed head tenderly against
his bosom, and intertwined his fingers lovingly in her
hair.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, best beloved," he said.  "And whatever
comes, defeat or victory, the thrill of triumph or the
darkness that is death, there will only be one vision
before me&mdash;the cool, grey eyes that looked into my
soul and found something there not wholly unworthy
of a woman's love."
</p>

<p>
"God who gave you to me, protect you," she sobbed,
"and teach me to live through to-day."
</p>

<p>
And as Saunders strode through the snow to the
Marienkastel there was no fear in his heart; merely a
great longing for the reunion which must come to
loyal hearts&mdash;here or hereafter.

<h3>
CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
<br><br>
THE PARLEY
</h3>

<p>
The Pariserhof, whither Mrs. Saunders betook herself
at her husband's desire, was sufficiently safe, both from
its situation and character, to form a rallying point
for non-combatants of both sexes and diverse nationalities.
From its upper stories an excellent view of the
hostilities could be obtained, and in its cellars there
was not only efficient shelter from chance missiles, but
a considerable mitigation of the thunder of artillery.
The latter apartments, therefore, were crowded with old
ladies and young children, with a sprinkling of sensitive
males who had come to Weissheim to recover nerve-tone
rather than to listen to gun-fire.  On the flat roof
over the great dining-hall Mrs. Saunders was standing,
field-glasses in hand, surveying the operations with a
steady and critical gaze.  Most often her glasses were
directed towards the Marienkastel, against which the
forces of the invading party were being gradually
focussed; but no sound passed her lips, neither did the
fine, white fingers that held the field-glasses twitch or
tremble in the least degree.  Hers was the curious,
irrational pride that prefers to hide its suffering,
though the suffering be doubled by the effort of
concealment.
</p>

<p>
A few adventurous spirits had sallied forth to other
points of vantage, where they could get a better,
though less secure, view of the rare spectacle afforded
by the fateful day.  But for once the curling-rink and
skating-rink belonging to the hotel were deserted; for
once the surface of the ice-runs was unscarred by the
iron runners of innumerable toboggans.  Only on
Major Flannel's private rink,&mdash;not far from the
Marienkastel itself,&mdash;the contest for the Flannel Cup
was proceeding as though the day was a day of sport
and not of war.  The keenest curlers in Weissheim
were there: "Skipper" Fraser, the sandy Scot, whose
perky humour lent such spice and piquancy to the most
tragic moments of the game; Major Flannel himself,
roaring out his commands, reproaches, and
encouragements in a voice which easily made itself heard
through the growing din of battle; Strudwick, the
gigantic American, who could always be relied on when
a "knock-out" shot was required; little Hobbs, the
Englishman, who sent down his stones in an unorthodox
manner, but always within an inch of where his "skipper"
wanted them, so that a particularly brilliant shot
came to be known, not as a "beauty" or a "daisy,"
but as a "Jimmy Hobbs."
</p>

<p>
But all the while Bernhardt had been developing his
plans with the deliberate skill of a born general.  He
had forced the enemy to unmask the batteries that
guarded the lower part of the town.  These he could
have forced at a price, had he willed, for, though
cunningly constructed, snow ramparts are not an effective
protection even against rifle fire.  But to have done
this would have meant long hours of heavy loss, with
the grim prospect of stern street fighting when the last
redoubt yielded to his superior forces.  Could he
capture the Marienkastel and establish the few pieces of
artillery he had brought so laboriously with him, the
town would be at his mercy, and he could make,&mdash;as he
had said,&mdash;any terms he wished.  By eleven o'clock the
movement against the old Schloss commenced in earnest.
Bernhardt might have brought his guns to bear
on the ancient masonry, but there were sentimental
reasons for not reducing the historic pile to a heap of
rubble; nor was he the man to waste time in an artillery
duel if the place could possibly be taken by a <i>coup
de main</i>.  The Marienkastel must be restored intact to
its rightful owner and peace dictated to the dethroned
monarch before the sun sank to rest behind the western
mountains.
</p>

<p>
So Saunders,&mdash;watching the course of operations
from a lofty tower,&mdash;perceived imposing bodies of
Infantry approaching against him on three sides.  On
they came on their skis over the soft snow&mdash;Guides in
extended order to the right, Sharpshooters cresting a
low bluff to the left, and throwing up a hasty
entrenchment of snow with the evident intention of
holding the hill against any retaliatory turning movement
on the part of the garrison; and in the centre,&mdash;clinging
to the wooded ground,&mdash;came a powerful force of
Guards in their winter fighting garb of white.  In
the extreme rear was Gloria with the reserve,
guarding the ammunition sleighs and a battery of field
guns.
</p>

<p>
Between the invaders and the Schloss lay the
bob-sleigh run, and Saunders,&mdash;expecting a bombardment
of the Marienkastel,&mdash;had filled the track with a strong
advance guard of his men.  The bob-run made an
excellent trench, and fortunately at this point had but
a very slight declivity, so that the men found no
difficulty in retaining their position on its glassy surface.
The track indeed started high up by the Marienkastel,
just above Major Flannel's curling-rink, and began
with a tremendously steep S-shaped curve, known as
"The Castle Leap"; then it went straight for a bit
and almost level, then wound round again with
gradually increasing steepness, and so on in a succession
of curves and bends till it joined the main road
some thousand feet below, near the hamlet of Riefinsdorf.
</p>

<p>
But before a shot was fired against the castle a small
party was seen approaching under a white flag.
Through his field-glasses Saunders detected the form
of his friend Trafford accompanied by a couple of
officers, all on skis.  Instantly Saunders sent out a
corresponding party, also under the white flag.  Trafford,
having expressed a desire to see the officer commanding
the Schloss, was blindfolded, together with his two
satellites, and conducted through the lines of the
defence to the enceinte of the Marienkastel.
</p>

<p>
"You are in the presence of the Commander," said
the officer who had conducted him to the courtyard,
where Saunders was awaiting him.  "What is it you
have to say?"
</p>

<p>
"My message is brief," said Trafford, speaking in
German, and saluting his unseen adversary.  "It can
be framed in one word&mdash;surrender!"
</p>

<p>
"And it can be answered in one word," replied
the Commander of the Marienkastel, also in German.
"And in a good English word&mdash;'No.'"
</p>

<p>
"Saunders, by all that's wonderful!" ejaculated
Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"The same, dear disturber of the peace."
</p>

<p>
"Then that makes things much easier.  I am a
humane man, as you know, and I have no particular
desire to kill or be killed.  We are in a position to
take this eligible chateau, which belongs of right to the
lady I am privileged to call Queen.  But in the taking
you will probably hurt a few of my loyal and trusty
followers, and we shall certainly damage some of
yours.  My suggestion is, that you should evacuate
with the full honours of war, retaining all arms and
standards, and playing any drums, bugles, or other
instruments of military music you may chance to
possess."
</p>

<p>
"And in return for our obliging courtesy?"
</p>

<p>
"We will give a free amnesty to all who have taken
part against her gracious Majesty Queen Gloria.  As
for one Karl, styling himself King of Grimland, he
can live anywhere he likes outside the territories,
possessions, and dependencies of the aforesaid Gloria, and
he will be granted a revenue of one hundred thousand
kronen per annum from the royal treasury."
</p>

<p>
"The proposition is dazzlingly attractive," returned
Saunders.  "But I regret that I must refuse.  My
orders leave me no alternative."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!" said Trafford warmly: "Here are
we, two Anglo-Saxons in the middle of a host of
benighted foreigners ready to fly at each others' throats!
What nobler or more dignified proceeding than to make
terms over their heads, prevent bloodshed, establish
peace, and inaugurate an era of good-will and prosperity?"
</p>

<p>
"A most ennobling idea," agreed Saunders, "and
one which can easily be carried out by your renouncing
your schemes of robbery and usurpation.  If you agree
to lay down your arms, and throw yourself on the
mercy of my royal master, I will use my influence with
him&mdash;which is considerable&mdash;to grant a full amnesty
to all traitors, rebels, and discontents, including yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Enough jesting!" cried Trafford.  "Gloria owns
nine-tenths of the country, and we have a sufficient
force with us to take Weissheim two or three times
over.  I want to save life&mdash;she wants to save life.  We
have no time to waste.  Will you surrender&mdash;yes or no?"
</p>

<p>
"No!"
</p>

<p>
Trafford stretched out his hand blindly in the
direction of his friend.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye!" he said soberly.  "In ten minutes we
shall be potting at each other.  I hope it won't be our
misfortune to hit each other."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye!" replied Saunders, gripping his
enemy's hand with a strong pressure.  "I share your
wish to the full.  I regret that circumstances do not
find us on the same side, but the fault is none of my
making."
</p>

<p>
There was a momentary silence and in that silence
was audible a peculiar humming, grinding roar, the
penetrating music of granite bowls gliding over thick
ice.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" asked Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"Curling," replied Saunders.  "A match on Major
Flannel's rink."
</p>

<p>
"Where's that?"  As much of Trafford's face as
was visible under the bandage looked thoughtful.
</p>

<p>
"Two hundred yards above us in a hollow near the
start of the bob-run.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," said Trafford.  "Only they ought to
be warned that they are playing a dangerous game.
A chance shot might convert a pleasant pastime into
a black tragedy."
</p>

<p>
"I sent to warn them half an hour ago," replied
Saunders, "but the sole reply was that they were
having a most interesting match, and that they hoped I
should have equally good sport."
</p>

<p>
Trafford laughed and gave his friend a final hand-grip.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, again," he said.  "I respect your decision
to stick to your post&mdash;but it is a pity,&mdash;a great
pity."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
<br><br>
TRAFFORD AND THE TRENCH
</h3>

<p>
Bernhardt himself was directing the movement
against the Marienkastel.  He dominated the whole
force as completely as though he had been trained to
the art of war instead of the services of the Church.
All felt that success depended on one man, and that
man was the keen-eyed enigma who seemed to blend a
strain of genius with the taint of madness in his
seething brain.
</p>

<p>
"Their answer?" he demanded of Trafford, on the
latter's return from his fruitless parley.
</p>

<p>
"See us d&mdash;&mdash;d first," replied the American.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!  That sounds like Saunders," said Bernhardt
with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"It <i>was</i> Saunders.  I'm sorry we couldn't come to
terms, but my friend is a pig-headed gentleman, and
he won't shift till we poke our rifles through the castle
windows."
</p>

<p>
"Dear Saunders!" exclaimed Bernhardt.  "How
like him to give us a good fight!  We'll rush a couple
of hundred men up for a frontal attack, and see what
happens.  Let it be the Guards under Captain
Zacchari.  Give the order now, if you please."
</p>

<p>
The charge sounded, and the men advanced in open
order, only to be met with a withering fire from the
advance guard entrenched in the bob-sleigh run.  A
good few dropped, and Bernhardt having learned what
he required, gave the command to halt.  The men
accordingly flung themselves prone in the deep snow,
occasionally sniping as a head showed itself above the
ice bank of the toboggan track.
</p>

<p>
"We must enfilade that trench," said Bernhardt to
Trafford, who had joined him.  "How long will it
take to get our guns up to the top of the run?"
</p>

<p>
"Two hours, if the enemy don't interfere.  Two
years, if they do.  It's a steep bit of hill, and this sun
is making the snow soft on the surface."
</p>

<p>
"True," agreed Bernhardt.  "Then we must advance
all along the line.  It will be costly, but we'll
give them a hot time when we get to close quarters."
</p>

<p>
"We shall lose at least a hundred men," objected
Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"More, I think," said Bernhardt coolly; "but we
shall take the Marienkastel."
</p>

<p>
"I've got an idea," said Trafford musingly.
</p>

<p>
"Out with it!"
</p>

<p>
"Give me twenty men and twenty minutes, and I'll
turn those fellows out of the bob-run&mdash;or my name's
not George Trafford."
</p>

<p>
"Choose your men and choose your moment," he
said, flashing a glance at his companion, "but
remember that time presses."
</p>

<p>
"I am ready now," said Trafford, his face alight
with enthusiasm.  "Any twenty men will do, provided
they are good ski-ers and know which end of a rifle
goes off."
</p>

<p>
Bernhardt gave the order for twenty men of the
Guides to attach themselves under Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"When you hear a bugle-call push on with all your
strength," said the latter; "and if you take Saunders
prisoner deal gently with him."
</p>

<p>
Making a detour in order to take all available
cover, Trafford led his men towards the starting point
of the bob-sleigh run.  His movement,&mdash;hidden by the
configuration of the ground,&mdash;was unnoted by the
garrison, nor did he meet with any opposition on his way.
The hum of the curling-stones led him on, and as he
drew nearer the stentorian shouts of the "skippers,"
as they sung out encouragement to the different
members of their sides.  When he reached the top of the
hill where the run commenced he found himself
looking down on to a frozen pond, whereon a number of
sunburnt men were plying brooms in front of a
slithering curling-stone.
</p>

<p>
"Sweep, boys, sweep!" yelled out Major Flannel.
"Bring it all the way!  It'll be a 'Jimmy Hobbs'
when it stops.  Up besoms, lads!  It's drawn the port!
Thank you, Hobbs&mdash;it's a beauty&mdash;right on the pot
lid.  Man, you're a curler!"
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," Trafford interrupted,
descending on to the ice, and saluting.  "I am sorry to
interrupt your pastime."
</p>

<p>
Major Flannel looked up and surveyed the intruder,
whose approach had been completely unnoticed by the
engrossed enthusiasts.
</p>

<p>
Trafford was in a dark-green uniform with a sword
at his side.  In one hand he bore a bugle, and in the
other a ski-ing pole.
</p>

<p>
What this warlike figure was doing on the curling-rink,
and why it should address him in faultless English
was a mystery to the worthy Major.  Then he
noticed that the high snow bank behind the rink was
crowned with a score of riflemen.  The game was
suspended, and the curlers gathered round the
intruder.
</p>

<p>
"Are we in the way of the fighting?" asked
"Sandy" Fraser.
</p>

<p>
"Not in the least," replied Trafford, with a smile:
"but all the same it is my painful duty to interrupt
your game."
</p>

<p>
"But we don't mind war risks," objected the Scot.
</p>

<p>
"So I have been told," said Trafford; "but the fact
is we want to borrow your curling-stones."
</p>

<p>
Mystification of the profoundest nature showed itself
on the faces of the curling fraternity.
</p>

<p>
"You're a humourist, sir," said Fraser at length.
</p>

<p>
"Among other things, yes," agreed Trafford; "but
at the present moment I'm in deadly, sober earnest.
We're trying to take the Marienkastel, but Karl's men
are holding the run, and unless we can dislodge them
it'll be a bloody business capturing the place.  I'm
sorry to spoil sport, but I must annex your curling-stones
in the name of Queen Gloria&mdash;you'll see why in
a minute."
</p>

<p>
And so saying, Trafford gave a command in German
to his men.  Instantly they jumped down on to the ice.
</p>

<p>
"Each man take a stone and carry it up to the top
of the toboggan run!" he called out.
</p>

<p>
There were only sixteen stones to the twenty men,
so four men were perforce inactive.  The others
proceeded to carry out the command with unquestioned
discipline.
</p>

<p>
"Man, man," expostulated "Sandy" Fraser
sorrowfully, "you're spoiling a gran' match."
</p>

<p>
But Major Flannel took a fiercer line of protest.
</p>

<p>
"What the blazes are you doing, sir?" he spluttered,
red with indignation.  "This is my rink, and
these stones are mine and my guests'."
</p>

<p>
The four soldiers who had had no stones allotted
them began to handle their rifles expectantly.
Trafford, however, checked any untoward action on their
part with a curt gesture and a quick-flung command.
</p>

<p>
"Force is an ugly kind of argument, gentlemen,"
he said, turning to the two "skippers."  "It grieves
me exceedingly to have to appeal to it.  Please do not
make my position any harder.  It is bad enough to
spoil the sport; it would be cruel if I had to spoil the
sportsmen."
</p>

<p>
Slowly and dimly, but nevertheless surely, the
Major began to perceive the hopelessness of arguing
the rights and wrongs of the situation.  He had a
profound contempt for any soldiers except those of his own
country, but a saving spark of common sense rescued
him from the tragic folly of resistance.
</p>

<p>
"I'd never built up a better 'house' in my life," he
said petulantly.  "We were lying 'two stones' and
with another shot to play might easily have been
three."
</p>

<p>
"Be careful of the pink stones with the blue ribbon
on the handle!" Fraser called out in exaggerated
trepidation.  "My mother's just sent them to me as
a Christmas present from Aberdeen."
</p>

<p>
A laugh followed this sally&mdash;good-humour was
restored.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," called out Trafford, "mount this
snow bank here with me, and you will see a sight that
will more than recompense you for a ruined game and
the possible loss of your curling-stones!"
</p>

<p>
So saying, Trafford himself mounted the snow bank
at the commencement of the bob-sleigh run.  The
curlers followed, one or two grumbling still, others with
a belated interest in the fortunes of the day.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then," cried Trafford in German, to his
command, "when I say 'go,' hurl those stones down the
toboggan-run!  All together, now&mdash;one, two, three,&mdash;go!"
</p>

<p>
The men swung back their granite burdens and then
hurled them with all their force on to the shining
surface of the icy track.  Swiftly the stones glided down
the sharp incline, gathering pace at every yard of their
downward course.  Round the first bend they swept,
banging against each other in a jostling rush of
irresistible momentum.
</p>

<p>
"That's one way of enfilading a trench," said
Trafford to the Major, as the last stone,&mdash;a pink one with
a blue ribbon,&mdash;swept out of sight.  "Shrapnel's not
in it with&mdash;Aberdeen granite;" and raising his bugle
to his lips he sounded the "charge," clear and true.
</p>

<p>
Then it was that the curlers had compensation for
their spoiled sport.  The whole line of the attack,
Guides, Sharpshooters, and Guards, seemed to spring
into being out of the snow, and hurl themselves in a
parallel rush towards the Marienkastel.  Bugles blew
wild music from their brazen throats; "Forwards!"
cried officers with drawn swords to their men, and
"Forwards!" the men cried back to them with the
deep-throated joy of battle.
</p>

<p>
"Forwards!" shouted Bernhardt, pressing with the
van, reckless of personal danger, conscious only of the
possible fear of others, and of the supreme importance
of pushing home the present attack at all
costs.
</p>

<p>
A spluttering volley rang out from the enemy's
entrenchment, but scarce a man of the attack dropped.
Nor was this to be wondered at: Saunders' men were
in confusion.  A curling-stone weighs about sixteen
pounds, and when it is travelling at a rate of forty
miles an hour is almost as deadly as a cannon-ball; nay,
they were more alarming than ordinary shot or shell,
for they were visible, and the men who might have
faced the unseen death struggled frantically to avoid
the visual peril of the granite avalanche.  There was
much breaking of bones and crushing of ribs, cries of
agony and groans of tribulation.  Rifles went off at
various angles, friends grappled with friends, and
many, pushed on by the weight of the accumulated
stones and the press of writhing limbs, began to slither
down the toboggan track,&mdash;even as Frau von Bilderbaum
and Von Hügelweiler had done two days before.
It was a moment of torment and confusion, a moment
when loyalty and discipline were helpless and unavailing,
a moment, indeed, when a much less determined
attack would have prevailed against such twisted chaos
and dismay.
</p>

<p>
"The Kastel's ours!" cried Trafford enthusiastically,
as Bernhardt's force swept irresistibly over the
toboggan run and pressed furiously to the walls of the
Schloss.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven help Saunders now!" he added, a swift
fear crossing his brain.  "By gad, they're bolting!"
he cried in glad surprise, as the garrison of the castle
streamed out and away with scarce a backward glance,
and never a backward shot at the triumphant enemy.
</p>

<p>
"That's not like Robert Saunders&mdash;but I'm glad,
devilish glad."
</p>

<p>
"Congratulations, sir!" said Major Flannel, shaking
Trafford warmly by the hand.  "I've seen a bit of
fighting in my day, and I've seen a bit of sport, but
I've never seen the two things blended so harmoniously
before in the whole course of my existence."
</p>

<p>
Trafford returned the hand-grip, but waited for no
further compliments from the enthusiastic Major.
Down beneath him, riding on a gun-carriage pulled
by a score of soldiers, Gloria van Schattenberg was
mounting the slope towards the long-forfeited home of
her ancestors.  And with bent knees and trailing pole
Trafford ski-ed down the incline, to be the first to offer
her congratulations on her victory.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap28"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
<br><br>
MEYER AT WORK
</h3>

<p>
Meyer had not disliked the battle quite so much as he
had expected.  Karl's winter palace, the Brunvarad,&mdash;where
he had taken up his headquarters,&mdash;was sufficiently
remote from the danger zone to allow his mind
to work coolly and collectedly on his master's behalf.
And on the whole he almost enjoyed it.  Karl was with
him, silent, almost sulky in the enforced inactivity
Fate and his councillors assigned him.  He would have
been happier in the trenches handling a rifle, or
sighting one of the big Creusot guns that barked defiance
at his foes.  But for the moment circumstances held
him in the little room where Meyer,&mdash;with a big map
spread before him, and a telephone receiver at his
ear,&mdash;issued the brief messages or despatched the brief
notes that meant so much to the issues of the day.
</p>

<p>
"War has been compared to the game of chess,"
remarked Meyer during a brief pause when the telephone
bell was silent, and no <i>aide-de-camp</i> rushed in
with his vital message from the front; "and if the
simile is trite and commonplace, it is certainly
especially applicable in this case.  One sacrifices piece for
piece, a pawn for a knight, a knight for a castle, and
so forth, and he who ultimately has the best of the
exchange has an easy victory at the finish.  In our
case we are sacrificing a castle&mdash;the Marienkastel&mdash;for
a Queen.  When the enemy's Queen is <i>hors-de-combat</i>
they can make but a poor bid for victory."
</p>

<p>
"The simile will bear pressing even closer," said
Karl surlily, "for by the rules of the game the king
can only move one step in any direction."  And with
a wave of his hand the discontented monarch indicated
the four walls which confined his activities.
</p>

<p>
"It is our duty to prevent you from being checkmated,
sire," returned the Commander-in-Chief.  "Personally,
I hold fighting a coarse sport, and am well
content to do the intellectual part at the end of the
telephone."
</p>

<p>
The ringing of the instrument punctuated his remark
with singular appropriateness.
</p>

<p>
"Well, who are you and what is it?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"I'm Saunders," returned a voice; "I'm in the
abatis in the churchyard."
</p>

<p>
Meyer glanced round at the clock.  It pointed to the
hour of twelve.
</p>

<p>
"Then you're there half an hour too soon," he returned.
</p>

<p>
"Not a moment, I assure you," came the reply.
"Trafford sent Major Flannel's curling-stones
hurtling down the bob-run, and spoilt the formation of
my advance guard.  In the confusion they rushed us,
and,&mdash;as I understood you did not want us to be wiped
out,&mdash;we bolted manfully for the <i>abatis</i>.  Here we are,
and here we'll remain as long as you wish."
</p>

<p>
"And what's happening in the Marienkastel?"
asked the Commander-in-Chief.
</p>

<p>
"Bernhardt's holding it in force."
</p>

<p>
"And his guns?"
</p>

<p>
"Are being slowly dragged up the snow slope."
</p>

<p>
"How long will it take to get them in position?"
</p>

<p>
"At least an hour.  The sun has made the snow soft."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Meyer.  "Stay where you are,
please, till further orders," and replacing the receiver
he rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Now, sire," he said, "the King can move more
than one step at a time."
</p>

<p>
"In what direction?"
</p>

<p>
"The Marienkastel."
</p>

<p>
They left the Brunvarad, Karl leading, by the great
doorway at the base of the armoury tower.  Here a
couple of horses were awaiting them&mdash;big, yellow,
maize-fed brutes, raw-boned and angular, but
serviceable steeds on a rough path or a frozen highway.
</p>

<p>
"I should feel a little happier if you would take me
into your complete confidence," said Karl as they rode
out of the palace courtyard.  "So far, I have listened
to one-sided conversations on the telephone, and brusque
orders to breathless <i>aides-de-camp</i>, but I hardly know
what portions of Weissheim are still mine and which
are Gloria's."
</p>

<p>
"The enemy have taken the Marienkastel, as we
intended they should, but&mdash;they have taken it
three-quarters of an hour too soon.  The insufferable
Trafford,&mdash;who saved your life and rent your kingdom,&mdash;has
the subtlety of the serpent without the harmlessness
of the dove.  He enfiladed Saunders' trench in
the bob-sleigh run with curling-stones, and in the
confusion Bernhardt rushed the Schloss."
</p>

<p>
"Cannot we re-capture it?" asked Karl.  "I should
not mind leading the forlorn hope."
</p>

<p>
"As my place is by my royal master's side," responded
Meyer drily, "I must veto the suggestion with
all the authority I possess."
</p>

<p>
"Then what are we to do?"
</p>

<p>
"Employ the enthusiasm of others, repress our own.
Von Hügelweiler, who hates Trafford and loves Gloria,&mdash;and
therefore would like to destroy them both,&mdash;is
waiting in Drechler's farm at the top of Sanatorium
Hill with a park of howitzers.  When he gets the order
the mortars will talk.  The distances have been
carefully measured, and the Marienkastel may already be
numbered among the disappearing relics of old Grimland."
</p>

<p>
"And the Princess Gloria?" asked Karl.
</p>

<p>
"Will cease to be an effective factor in Grimland
politics."
</p>

<p>
Karl frowned.  He had been ruthless enough in
1904, but then he was fighting against men.  He was
no sentimentalist, and he meant holding his own,
though regiments were decimated in the process, and
the snows of his beloved Weissheim were stained
scarlet with good blood.  But he had ever had a soft
corner in his heart for the laughter-loving Princess, and
his spirits sank at the prospect of her bright young
life being sacrificed to the brutal, senseless Moloch of
civil strife.  The rough, fierce men who held the
uplands for him were fair game for powder and shot, the
levies of the plain were <i>chair a cannon</i>, maybe; but
Gloria von Schattenberg was a creature of too delicate
flesh to be maimed by live shell or splintering
masonry, and his manhood revolted at the gruesome
prospect.
</p>

<p>
"We must try and save the Princess," he said after
a minute's silence.
</p>

<p>
Meyer said nothing.  The nearer they advanced to
the scene of action the lower his spirits fell.  The sun
was high in the cloudless heavens, and the distant
mountains reared their snowy crests against a blue that
was astounding in its intensity.  A purple haze swam
in the hollows of the hills; the buntings twittered in
cheerful chorus amidst the dripping pine trees, now
that their song was broken no longer by the crude
music of the cannons' roar.  For the moment Nature
spoke of peace, but Meyer knew that there was no
peace.  There was a pause in the struggle, a lull
before the storm, a moment when, by mutual consent, the
hand-grip was relaxed, preparatory to the final
struggle when one combatant or the other would be forced
ruthlessly to his knees.  And Meyer in his room,
directing movements from a distance, was a very different
person from Meyer within striking distance of a mobile
foe.  The man had no stomach for fighting.  His
mouth was dry and his pulses drumming a craven
melody in his ears.  He was afraid, and he was
painfully conscious of his fear; but although his suffering
was acute his brain was working tolerably well behind
the half-shut eyes.
</p>

<p>
There is a kind of cowardice that never loses its
self-control at a crisis, just as there is a kind of bravery
that never keeps it.
</p>

<p>
A turn of their path brought them into the main
road running between the town of Weissheim and the
Marienkastel; and if there had been peace in the outlook
over the matchless valley of the Niederkessel and
amidst the high sanctuaries of the mountains, there
was war here in stern evidence and grim reality.
Upward pressed the troops who had held the redoubts of
the lower town, and whose presence was now needed on
higher ground.  Downward, on sleighs painted with
the red cross of mercy, progressed those who had
suffered in the brief defence of the Marienkastel.  Karl
and his General saluted, the latter with no softening
of his cynical features, but a strange numbness of his
breast that was fear tempered, perhaps, with mercy,
certainly with horror.  A couple of hundred yards up
the road they halted; here, within easy range of the
Marienkastel, but protected by the banked-up snow
at the side of the road, were gathered a considerable
number of soldiers under the eye of General von
Bilderbaum.  The latter advanced and saluted as soon as he
saw his Sovereign.
</p>

<p>
"How are matters progressing, General?"  asked
the King.
</p>

<p>
"They are not progressing, sire," replied the General
bluntly.  "We are doing nothing, while the enemy
is doing much.  In forty minutes their guns will be in
position, and the loyal town of Weissheim will be wiped
off the map."
</p>

<p>
"Meyer does not seem to have bestowed his
confidences very widely," returned Karl.  "I have only just
learned that there is a battery of howitzers waiting to
pound the Marienkastel into brick-dust.  Why they do
not commence pounding is known only to my intelligent
Commander-in-Chief."
</p>

<p>
"When one destroys a wasps' nest," said Meyer
smiling, "it is wise to protect oneself against the
inmates.  When the castle becomes untenable Bernhardt
and his men will buzz out in a thoroughly bad temper.
Unless this road, where we now are, is held strongly,
there is nothing to prevent them taking their afternoon
tea in the Brunvarad."
</p>

<p>
Karl nodded; despite his present irritability he had
considerable faith in his Commander-in-Chief.  Not so
old Bilderbaum.
</p>

<p>
"What about these howitzers?" he asked scornfully.
"What is there to prevent Bernhardt rushing them?
Where are they?"
</p>

<p>
"They are in a very safe place," said Meyer with
a wave of his hand to the right.  "If Bernhardt means
to storm them he'll have to face six quick-firers and
two hundred riflemen on either flank; also he'll have to
climb a quarter of a mile of soft snow without a stick
of cover for his men.  Anyone who can reach those
howitzers may keep them as a memento of a warm afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"And who is in command?" asked the still
unconvinced General.
</p>

<p>
"Von Hügelweiler," replied Meyer.
</p>

<p>
General Bilderbaum uttered a sonorous oath that
was more like a roar than an expletive.
</p>

<p>
"Hügelweiler!" he cried.  "I wouldn't trust him
with a corporal's guard.  He's a liar and a traitor
on his own confession."
</p>

<p>
"He is probably both," agreed Meyer, "and he is
also a bitterly disappointed man.  The gentleman for
whom his hatred is being nursed is now in the
Marienkastel, and I don't think you need have any anxiety as
to the accuracy of Von Hügelweiler's guns."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Meyer's calm assurance won silence.
The troops continued to arrive from the lower town
and take their appointed positions on the road that
led to Weissheim.  The Commander-in-Chief might be
making mistakes, but if so they were not the errors of
a stupid mind.  Karl began for the first time to
appreciate the true merits of the Jew's scheme.  When
the invaders' position in the castle was rendered
untenable they would have no path open to them but the
one by which they had come.  Then, doubtless having
frittered away their strength in vain efforts to break
through to Weissheim, Meyer would deliver a crushing
counter attack as they drew off, spent and shattered,
down the hillside.  Von Bilderbaum, however, failed to
see things with the same eye of faith.
</p>

<p>
"Why doesn't Von Hügelweiler open fire now?" he
demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Because he has not received the order to do so,"
Meyer replied.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" persisted Bilderbaum.
</p>

<p>
Meyer's eyes contracted.  He had the air of a wise
man dealing with a foolish one; and when he spoke it
was with more than a touch of impatience.
</p>

<p>
"The enemy's guns are now half-way up the hill,"
he said.  "When they have kindly brought them the
whole way we shall have something to say to them."
</p>

<p>
"And they may have something to say to us,"
retorted the General.
</p>

<p>
Meyer shrugged his shoulders, as if convinced of the
hopelessness of trying to instil intelligence into the
other's skull.
</p>

<p>
"If I were you," went on Bilderbaum, "I should
send a couple of regiments full pelt against those
guns.  We might bring off a very effective ski-charge
down the slope."
</p>

<p>
"And lose fifty or sixty men," sneered Meyer.
</p>

<p>
"It would at any rate be fighting.  At the present
moment we're lowering the <i>morale</i> of our troops by
palsied inaction."
</p>

<p>
"If General von Bilderbaum were in supreme command
of his Majesty's forces," said Meyer, "I have
no doubt that the battle would be short, sharp, and
decisive&mdash;only the decision would not be in our favour."
</p>

<p>
Von Bilderbaum flushed scarlet.  He was essentially
a fighting man, with the fighting man's contempt of
the Jew, and his calculated inactivity.
</p>

<p>
Meyer's gentle gift of rudeness pierced his thick
skin with inflaming venom.  A sense of discipline and
the presence of the enemy alone restrained him from
violence.  In despair he turned to his Sovereign.
</p>

<p>
"Have I your permission to head a charge against
the guns, sire?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
But Karl's face had taken on a new look of decision.
</p>

<p>
"You have not," he replied firmly.  "Any fool can
head a charge.  I suggested doing so myself half an
hour ago.  In theory I am a King and you a General;
in practice we are pawns in Meyer's game.  It is wisest
to accept our limitations, and only to move when and
where we are told.  If I can submit, Von Bilderbaum,
surely you can, too."
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty's words are very touching," said
Meyer in his colourless tones, which might have
concealed the profoundest contempt or the most genuine
feeling.  "This is the hour of the savant, of the
professor of '<i>Kriegspiel</i>,' of the man whose brain is
unaffected by the glamour of heroism or the poetry of
shock tactics.  The hour of the fighting man will come
later&mdash;your hour, Von Bilderbaum&mdash;the hour of big
deeds and little cunning, of personal glory and the
primordial joy of destruction.  Believe me, General, I
envy you your hour more than you grudge me mine.
It is better to be a fighting dog than a pusillanimous
old fox."
</p>

<p>
Bilderbaum looked his superior squarely between the
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You were a fighting dog, yourself, in 1904," he
retorted.
</p>

<p>
"For ten minutes," sneered the Commander-in-Chief.
</p>

<p>
"For ten very useful and strenuous minutes,"
maintained the General.  "I am not sure that I am not
proud of serving under you.  I am quite sure that it
is a good thing for his Majesty that you are not
serving under me."
</p>

<p>
Meyer ignored the honourable concession.  He was
gazing through his field-glasses at the distant guns,
which were now three parts of the way up the hill.
</p>

<p>
"The secret of military success," he murmured,
extracting his notebook and scribbling something in it,
"is to strike when the iron's hot&mdash;not before.  Give
that to your A.D.C., General," he went on, tearing out
the leaf and folding it, "and tell him to take it
instantly to the officer in command of the howitzer
battery on Sanatorium Hill.  The moment has arrived for
destroying the wasps' nest."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
<br><br>
NEWS FROM THE CAPITAL
</h3>

<p>
The battle of Weissheim was a very small affair,
viewed from an European standpoint.  The forces
engaged on either side were trivial, and the issues at
stake of comparative indifference to all save those
directly concerned; and yet it was not devoid of
picturesqueness in its incidents, nor even of academic interest
to those who study the conduct of military operations
in the high regions of deep snow and zero frosts.  The
bombardment of the Marienkastel was an excellent
example of concentrated artillery fire on a mediæval
building, of the efficacy of modern explosives on ancient
masonry, of the superiority of iron and melinite to
stone and concrete.  Bernhardt's gallant attempt to
storm the destructive battery was as noble in its way
as the heroic charge at Balaclava; its failure was even
more pronounced.  He returned from that spirited
enterprise with half his men and a rifle bullet in his
dangling left arm, but with an unbroken spirit and
untamed energy.
</p>

<p>
The Marienkastel existed no longer as a building.
Its halls were unroofed, its great tower but dwarf piers
of splintered masonry.  The position,&mdash;which had been
captured with such skill and gallantry,&mdash;had been but
a bait in the enemy's trap.  The Marienkastel, indeed,
commanded Weissheim, but Sanatorium Hill
commanded the Marienkastel.  The ex-priest's local
knowledge had been inferior to Meyer's, and that inferiority
spelt the difference between winning and losing the
battle.
</p>

<p>
During Bernhardt's absence on his desperate effort
to spike Von Hügelweiler's mortars, Trafford had been
left in command of the castle.  Finding his position
untenable and his losses increasing at an appalling rate,
he drew off to the sheltered ground by Major Flannel's
curling-rink.  Here they were safe from attack,
and at the same time powerless for purposes of
aggression.  Gloria was with him, bitter at the
destruction of her home, sick at the loss of her followers,
anxious to do some desperate action which should win
back their lost advantage.
</p>

<p>
The day which had opened with triumph seemed destined
to close in shame.  A man's courage was in her
heart, a stubborn pride in her vigorous blood, but the
sight of the wounded,&mdash;sufferers for her ambition,&mdash;won
a softer mood, and she hastened to give comfort
where she could no longer arouse enthusiasm.  At
about three o'clock in the afternoon Bernhardt and his
remnant entered the hollow, which Trafford had now
put in a position of defence.  The ex-priest looked
round at the entrenched riflemen and the guns in their
snow embrasures, and laughed mockingly.
</p>

<p>
"On what can you train your guns here?" he asked,
attempting to bind his wounded arm with the aid of
his uninjured member and his strong teeth.
</p>

<p>
"On anyone who wants to play a game on Major
Flannel's rink," Trafford replied, tendering his
assistance for the stricken limb.  "Our motto for the
moment is 'defence not defiance.'  We cannot hurt
the enemy, and the next best thing is not to let him
hurt us."
</p>

<p>
"And you are content with that?" asked Bernhardt
with scorn.
</p>

<p>
"I have a beautiful nature," the American replied
quietly, "and I accept the decrees of Providence in
a chastened spirit.  We came to capture a town and
a king, and we have captured&mdash;a curling-rink!
Unfortunately we have sent the curling-stones down the
bob-sleigh run, so we are unable to derive much benefit
from our achievement."
</p>

<p>
Bernhardt looked wonderingly at the other.
</p>

<p>
"And men call <i>me</i> mad," he said after a pause.
</p>

<p>
"And with reason," retorted Trafford.  "You are
a Napoleon <i>in parvo</i>, a man who desires big things
quite apart from their intrinsic value.  You want a
kingdom for your playground, and princes for your
playthings; that is what scientists call megalomania,
and I, bad taste.  There are better things at hand for
the normal man: a wife and children and a good
conscience."
</p>

<p>
"A coward's creed!" was Bernhardt's comment.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe, but mine."
</p>

<p>
Bernhardt tossed his head in despairing amazement.
</p>

<p>
"To think that you of all men should sink so hopelessly
at our first rebuff!&mdash;Trafford, the hero of the
revolution, is no better than a craven!"
</p>

<p>
"There is more than one kind of cowardice, Bernhardt,"
rejoined Trafford without heat; "and I admit
I was a coward in the Marienkastel, when the shells
dropped and buried men alive under tottering walls.
I don't think I was ever afraid before, but then I had
never been in action with&mdash;with a woman."
</p>

<p>
"But 'perfect love casteth out fear,'" mocked
Bernhardt.
</p>

<p>
"Then is my love very far from perfect," came the
ready answer.  "I was in a very torment of anxiety.
A good man groaning out his life with a lump of lead
in his breast, and a broken wall across his legs, is bad
enough, but she"&mdash;and Trafford pointed to Gloria,
who was engaged in tending a poor, disfigured wretch
who had been moved from the stricken castle&mdash;"my
God, Bernhardt, I was a coward!"
</p>

<p>
"Women don't feel pain as much as men," said
Bernhardt brutally.  "Our anxiety on their account is
a purely selfish sentiment based on the lowest instincts."
</p>

<p>
"Your theory would be preposterous even if we
were animals," replied Trafford.  "As applied to
humanity it is blasphemy.  I fancy your wound hurts
you."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, my wound hurts me&mdash;not the wound in my
arm&mdash;I don't feel that&mdash;but the wound in my spirit.
I am not one to sit down under defeat."
</p>

<p>
"Then what do you propose to do?"
</p>

<p>
"Push on to the Brunvarad!"
</p>

<p>
"And play Meyer's game for him!  The road is
held with every rifle and quick-firer they can cram
into it."
</p>

<p>
"We can get through at a price," said Bernhardt
between his teeth.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think we could get through at any price,"
rejoined Trafford with conviction.  "If we go on we
are beaten men; if we stay here we may make a draw
of it."
</p>

<p>
Bernhardt uttered an exclamation of contempt.
</p>

<p>
"There is no such word in Grimland," he said.
"We either win victory or we drain the cup of defeat
to its dregs.  Are we to return to the good loyal town
of Weidenbruck and say, 'We have lost three hundred
men and a dozen guns; we have not captured Weissheim,
nor taken Karl, but we have made a draw of it?
Strew garlands in our path and deck your houses with
bunting, for we have escaped total destruction!'
</p>

<p>
"I was not suggesting returning to Weidenbruck,"
said Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"Can we stay here?  What are we to eat?  Where
are we to sleep?  The nights are far from warm at
these altitudes.  To sleep out of doors at Weissheim;
is to sleep the sleep that knows no waking.  If we
cannot go forward we must fall back on our communications
at Wallen.  The hospitality of Major Flannel's
curling-rink is not one to be accepted permanently."
</p>

<p>
Trafford was silenced.  Events had landed them in
an <i>impasse</i>, and to curse the whole folly of the
expedition was alike ignoble and unprofitable.
</p>

<p>
It might have been wiser,&mdash;as he had advocated at
Wallen,&mdash;to have abandoned the scheme of conquest,
to have sought the joys of life in quiet retirement
from the scene of clashing ambitions and frenzied
upheavals; but the expedition had gone on to its fate
and he had gone, consenting, with it.  And things
being as they were, Bernhardt's logic was relentlessly
true.  To go back with their purpose unfulfilled was
to test the brittle fabric of the sullen Weidenbruckers'
allegiance with too shrewd a strain.  And if they could
not go forward they must go back.  In grim
perplexity he called to Gloria.
</p>

<p>
"Is it worth while trying to force the road to
Weidenbruck?" he asked her.
</p>

<p>
"If you had been tending wounded men, you would
not ask such a question," she replied quietly.
</p>

<p>
"I thought the Schattenbergs rose to great heights
in great difficulties," sneered Bernhardt.  "If we are
shirk our butcher's bill&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We have made our mistakes," she interrupted.
"Our only chance is for them to make theirs.  If we
stay here they may attack us."
</p>

<p>
"Meyer doesn't make mistakes," said the ex-priest,
"and if he did it would not be a mistake of that kind.
If we stay here the only foes that will attack us will
be General Frost and Brigadier Hunger; against such
we have no defence."
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me," said Trafford, "that to go forward
is madness, to go back madness, to stay here is
madness; and as we must do one of these three things,
madness is our portion.  Now the most effective kind
of lunacy seems to me to stay here till night-fall."
</p>

<p>
"And then hazard a night attack?" questioned
Gloria hopefully.
</p>

<p>
"Not an attack," rejoined Trafford.  "Meyer has
very sound theories of defence, and his searchlights
are sure to be in excellent working order.  No; we
must drop the soldier and become burglars.  Where
a thousand, or even a hundred, would fail, half a dozen
may succeed; and the object of our burglary must be
Karl.  If we can secure his person and return with it
to the capital, we shall have done all,&mdash;or nearly all,&mdash;we
attempted.  Weissheim is loyal to an individual not
a dynasty, and Karl in the Strafeburg would be a much
less attractive person than Karl in the Brunvarad."
</p>

<p>
Bernhardt laughed softly.
</p>

<p>
"I begin to have hopes of you again," he said.
</p>

<p>
Gloria clapped her hands excitedly.
</p>

<p>
"I knew you would find some way out of the difficulty!"
she cried.  "There is no such thing as despair
with you in our counsels."
</p>

<p>
"I am fighting for a high stake," Trafford replied.
"If I can win success out of the tangled disorder of
our fortunes you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If you can capture Karl," she interrupted, "I am
sure there will be no political objection to your
being&mdash;being my consort."
</p>

<p>
"Only personal objections?" he hazarded.
</p>

<p>
"There will be none," she said, "I swear it.  You
are a most gallant and resourceful gentleman, and
I might search my kingdom over for your equal."
</p>

<p>
Trafford noted the genuine enthusiasm of her tones,
and nodded grimly.
</p>

<p>
"You are what they call a 'throw-back,' your
Majesty," he said.  "You should have lived five
hundred years ago, in the age of joust and tourney, when
men won their wives by driving enormous spears
through the breastbones of their less muscular rivals."
</p>

<p>
"And you are of the Middle Ages too," she countered;
"your ideals, like mine, go back to the early days
of chivalry."
</p>

<p>
"The days of the rack and the Iron Maiden?
No, I assure you that with all my faults I am more
up-to-date than that.  Romance is a fine thing on paper,
but in my heart of hearts I would win my soul's desire
with a gentle wooing.  But to return to our <i>moutons</i>:
does the plan I have outlined commend itself to my
friend Bernhardt?"
</p>

<p>
"If your proposal had been to put a bullet through
Karl's cranium I should say that it bordered on sanity,"
replied Bernhardt.  "But even that would be difficult.
Meyer stands or falls by Karl's supremacy&mdash;and the
Jew is not a man to let his position be forfeited for
want of forethought.  He will watch over Karl's sacred
person as a mother watches over her first-born.  Still,
we might scheme an attempt for stalking the royal
stag."
</p>

<p>
"I suggested turning burglar," said Trafford.  "I
consider that a sufficient descent in the social scale,
without turning murderer."
</p>

<p>
"You have not the advantage of being an
<i>absintheur</i>," was Bernhardt's rejoinder.  But at this
point the conversation was interrupted; an officer of
the Guides had approached and was standing at the
salute.
</p>

<p>
"A man to see your Excellency," he began, to
Bernhardt.
</p>

<p>
"Where from?"
</p>

<p>
"Weidenbruck."
</p>

<p>
"His name?"
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Matti."
</p>

<p>
Bernhardt whistled.
</p>

<p>
"His business?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Private and confidential."
</p>

<p>
"Hum!  Conduct him here, please."
</p>

<p>
A moment later the doctor stood before them.  He
was arrayed in a woollen jersey, with a Jäeger scarf
around his neck.  Grey-green knickerbockers and
yellow putties veiled his nether limbs.  He was wearing
smoked glasses, and his feet were shod with skis.  His
head was bare, and his hair wet and tangled, as though
it had had intimate acquaintance with the snow.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing here?" demanded the ex-priest.
</p>

<p>
"I come as a messenger and a fugitive," replied the
doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Your news?"
</p>

<p>
"Weidenbruck is in a condition of anarchy.  You
left me as a dictator, but you deprived me of a
dictator's only argument&mdash;force.  You drained the city of
troops, and you expected me to impose my will on
that turbulent and sinful community.  My will was
to purify the <i>stadt</i>.  My men raided the gambling-houses
round the Goose-market; they harried the
infamous dens of the Hahngasse.  I closed the Mailand
Kurhaus and that other haunt of immorality, the
Augustus Café.  For forty-eight hours virtue
triumphed, and the worst features of my native town
began to disappear with exhilarating rapidity.  Then
the forces of sin and debauchery put their evil heads
together, and the reaction began.  My police were
suborned.  The cry was raised that a worse tyranny
than Karl's had been inaugurated.  Rumours that Karl
was holding his own and more began to be disseminated
in the capital.  It was whispered that guilty relations
had been established between the young Queen and the
accursed American.  There was a riot.  I called out
the soldiers, but they were too few and not over willing.
The people who had hounded Karl from his throne
cheered his name in the same streets where they had
sought his blood.  I am no coward, but I was appalled.
To calm the tempest would have needed an army
corps."
</p>

<p>
"Or Father Bernhardt," interrupted Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, I fled," the doctor resumed, "because I
saw how imperative it was that you should return as
soon as you had won your victory."
</p>

<p>
"And left the city to anarchy?" put in Gloria.
</p>

<p>
"I left the sons of worthlessness to their own
confusion."
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Matti," said Bernhardt, "you are one of those
amiable beings who have theories.  If you had amused
the Weidenbruckers,&mdash;or even let them amuse
themselves,&mdash;all might have been well.  Instead, however,
you tried to turn them into angels,&mdash;a role which
Providence has not assigned to any community east of
Berlin."
</p>

<p>
"I meant well&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That is what I complain of," interrupted Bernhardt.
</p>

<p>
"But the situation is only temporarily serious,"
interposed the hapless doctor.  "When you have
captured Weissheim&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"When we have captured Weissheim," said Trafford.
"Unfortunately we are about a quarter of a mile
further from Weissheim than we were two hours ago.
And two hours hence we shall very probably be further
still."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens!  You&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We are like you, Dr. Matti," went on Trafford.
"We have had a failure; like you, we over-rated our
own skill and under-rated our enemies'.  The situation
is bad."
</p>

<p>
Matti was silent, but his big, plebeian features
showed plainly the disappointment and consternation
of his mind.  The short winter day was winning to its
close.  Already the sun was falling behind the great
wall of the distant mountains; already the snows of the
Klauigberg were flushing rose-pink against the greening
turquoise of the cloudless sky.  A chill had crept
into the air, the surface of the curling-rink,&mdash;which
had been wet under the sun's mid-day power,&mdash;was now
as slippery as a polished mirror.  In an hour it would
be dark, and with the dark would come the intense cold
that meant death to all that failed to find a night's
shelter.
</p>

<p>
"It is time we fell back towards Wallen," said
Bernhardt to Gloria.  "I and Trafford will stay behind
with a few trusty spirits.  If all goes well we will join
you to-morrow morning."
</p>

<p>
"I am going to stay behind too," said Gloria
quietly.  "Colonel Schale can conduct the retreat."
</p>

<p>
"I too will stay behind," said Dr. Matti.  "I am
further from Weidenbruck here than at Wallen."
</p>

<p>
Bernhardt looked at the doctor's heavy, determined
features, and nodded.
</p>

<p>
"We four," he muttered.  "It is enough!  My
wound burns like fire; the cold has got into it, and it
will mortify.  To-morrow Dr. Matti can remove the
gangrened limb."
</p>

<p>
Matti's professional instincts were roused by the last
words.
</p>

<p>
"You are wounded?" he said.  "You had best let
me remove the bullet at once."  He produced from his
person a small bottle containing a colourless fluid.  "I
was prepared for emergencies of this nature.  A whiff
of chloroform&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To the devil with your anæsthetics!" cried
Bernhardt hotly.  "My brain is wanted to-night; my
<i>brain</i>, Herr Doctor, not a fuddled mass of drugged
cells and inert tissue!  Take out the bullet if you will,
but don't imagine I shall flinch under the knife.  There
is no pain that I can feel but the pain of disappointment."
</p>

<p>
"But a mere whiff," began the worthy doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Do as he bids," said Trafford, taking the bottle
from Matti's hand and putting it for safety into his
pocket.  "That may come in useful later.  But I
should take out the bullet, if you can," he whispered;
"there is a queer look in his eyes, and I fancy the
pain is making him light-headed."
</p>

<p>
"Come, cut out the little lump of lead, doctor," said
Bernhardt, "the little messenger that meant so much
harm and achieved so little.  Cut deep, Matti, and do
not stint the knife.  Only leave me my right arm and
my brain; for to-night there will be great doings
between the dusk and the dawn.  Aye, Bernhardt," he
went on, talking to himself, "you must rise to great
heights.  There will be friends to help you&mdash;a mad
Yankee, a Puritan doctor, and the last of the
Schattenbergs.  A strange trinity!  Nor must I forget my
good councillor Archmedai.  He must be very near me
to-night.  Herr Trafford, I have a flask at my belt;
it is difficult for me to undo it with one hand.  Kindly
assist me.  A thousand thanks!  I drink to our success
to-night, I drink to the devil in the devil's own
tipple.  Death to Karl!  Joy to Trafford and his
bride!  And to Bernhardt&mdash;&mdash;" he tossed down a full
measure of his beloved absinthe&mdash;"to Bernhardt I
drink"&mdash;his speech thickened and his eyes wandered
vaguely over the group.  He drank again&mdash;"To
Bernhardt I pledge&mdash;the great unknown!"

<h3>
CHAPTER THIRTY
<br><br>
RECRUITS
</h3>

<p>
By the fireplace of the great hall of the Brunvarad, Karl
was standing with his two Generals, Meyer and Von
Bilderbaum.  It was six o'clock, and with the falling
of night a thin haze of clouds had swept up from
Austria, and a mist of fine snow was descending with
silent persistence on hill and roof, rink and run, on the
inviolate forts of Meyer's planning, and on the battered
remains of the Marienkastel.  Within the palace
abundant electric light and blazing logs lent cheerfulness
to the great stone walls of the chamber, and the
huge dark beams that spanned them.  On the men's
coats were rapidly diminishing tokens of the storm
without.
</p>

<p>
"I have to thank you for your congratulations,"
Karl was saying as he shook the snow from his cap
into the spluttering flame, "and to thank you more
especially for the efforts which have rendered those
congratulations applicable."
</p>

<p>
Von Bilderbaum tugged nervously at his huge white
moustache.
</p>

<p>
"I had so little to do, sire," he protested.  "If I
had headed a ski charge&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You would probably not be here to receive my
thanks," interrupted Karl with a kindly laugh and a
hand laid roughly on the old General's shoulder.  "I'm
sure Frau von Bilderbaum will agree with me, that
Meyer's tactical passivity was superb.  Meyer, again
I thank you.  You have served me well."
</p>

<p>
"My motives for doing so were so obvious," drawled
the Commander-in-Chief.  "Had Bernhardt won I
should probably have been shot; certainly exposed to
danger and hardships.  As it is, I shall sleep well
to-night in a comfortable room, with the pleasing conviction
that your Majesty's gratitude will ultimately take
a tangible form."
</p>

<p>
Karl laughed heartily.  His eye was very bright, and
the burden of many years seemed taken off his wide
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Upon my word," he said, "I sometimes pity my
dear cousins of Germany and England, who rule over
united and contented kingdoms.  I have my anxieties,
God knows, but I also have my compensations.  Fair
weather is a pleasant thing, but it is the storm that
distinguishes the friend from the parasite."
</p>

<p>
The great bell of the Brunvarad clanged, and a
minute later Bomcke announced Robert Saunders and
his wife.
</p>

<p>
"We come to offer your Majesty our congratulations,"
said Saunders.
</p>

<p>
Karl took the Englishman's hand, and held it in a
firm grasp.
</p>

<p>
"You are a lucky man," he said with a glance at
Mrs. Saunders' radiant cheeks.  "You possess the
silver of friendship and the gold of love.  I have only
friendship, and therefore I prize the lesser metal at
great value.  If this day is the turning-point of my
fortunes, and I become King again of a whole country,
I shall not esteem my happiness complete unless my
friend, Robert Saunders, is my right-hand man."
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty's fortunes are assured," said
Saunders.  "The enemy is half-way back to Wallen
by now."
</p>

<p>
"And is being pursued?" asked Karl.
</p>

<p>
"Von Hügelweiler begged leave to harry them," said
Meyer, "and he is harrying them to such purpose that
they have shed their guns one by one in their flight.
Had it not been for the snow-storm he might have
captured a hundred or two prisoners."
</p>

<p>
"I think," said Karl, "we will not push our victory
further.  We have won the day, and there has been
sufficiency of bloodshed.  To-night I am a happy man,
and I wish no one ill.  Meyer, give orders for Von
Hügelweiler to be recalled.  He has done his work well,
and he shall have his reward."
</p>

<p>
Meyer withdrew with a shrug to the room where the
telephone was installed.
</p>

<p>
"It is good to see your Majesty happy," said
Mrs. Saunders in the silence that followed Meyer's departure.
"There has sat a cloud on your brow ever since we
have been in Grimland.  And to-night for the first time
the cloud is gone, and there is sunshine&mdash;the old
sunshine of 1904&mdash;in your face."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, I am happy," assented Karl with a smile,
"happy in my friends."
</p>

<p>
"Here comes another happy person," said Saunders
with an upward glance to the staircase, down which the
spacious person of Frau von Bilderbaum was slowly
descending.
</p>

<p>
"Truly spoken," said Karl, for as the ex-maid-of-honour
caught sight of her lord and master she quickened
her footsteps to a bovine canter, and hurled herself
enthusiastically on to the General's breast.
</p>

<p>
"My brave, brave Heinrich!" she gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, at all!" murmured the warrior, disengaging
himself gently from the overpowering embrace.
"I have done literally nothing.  Now, if there had been
a ski-charge&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
At this moment Meyer returned from the telephone.
</p>

<p>
"I have sent to recall Hügelweiler," he said; "but
I must say I think the policy of mercy is being over-done.
My forbears of Palestine were not half so kind
when they got the Amalekites on the run."
</p>

<p>
"We are not dealing with Amalekites," said Karl,
"but with Grimlanders, who happen to be our
fellow-countrymen.  But come, ladies and gentlemen, let us
eat, drink, and be merry, for the storm is over and the
sun is already gleaming through the thin edges of the
cloud-wrack."
</p>

<p>
"I am not a weather prophet," said Meyer, "nor
did Providence assign to me a sanguine temperament.
We have hit the enemy hard, and we have drawn most
of his teeth, but until Bernhardt's dead body is
discovered stiffening in the snow I have no intention of
celebrating a decisive victory."
</p>

<p>
"Don't do so, then, dear raven," laughed Karl, "but
at least take food for your strength's sake.  At any
rate, I hear that Bernhardt was wounded in the attack
on Sanatorium Hill."
</p>

<p>
"A wounded tiger is not a particularly innocuous
beast," returned the Commander-in-Chief, "and there
is a certain friend of Herr Saunders who has the unpleasant
gift of rising superior to difficulties, and whom
I fear is not even wounded."
</p>

<p>
The meal at the Brunvarad was neither very long
nor very festive.  Meyer's taciturn refusal to admit
premature victory had a distinctly damping effect on
the spirits of the company.  Noises of revelry and
jubilation were audible from the world without, <i>feux de
joie</i>, rockets, songs of carousal and bursts of cheering
broke in on the desultory conversation that flowed
fitfully round the royal dining-table.  But these sounds
of jubilation only brought a deeper frown to the
features of Von Bilderbaum, an added sneer to the lips
of the Commander-in-Chief; even the King began to
lose the exaltation that had so illumined his countenance.
</p>

<p>
"The Weissheimer is in his element to-night," said
Meyer.  "He believes himself a hero, and will get most
heroically drunk.  If Bernhardt's retreat is only a
ruse,&mdash;as I suspect,&mdash;he will return in the small hours and
capture a town guarded by fuddled swine."
</p>

<p>
"Is there no discipline in my army?" asked Karl
irritably.
</p>

<p>
"Very little just at present," was Meyer's cool reply.
"Our friends have stood by us at a pinch; it is too
much to expect them to keep sober when the danger is
apparently over."
</p>

<p>
Karl rose angrily to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"And are we to assume," he demanded, "that the
garrisons of our redoubts are drunk at their posts?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," said Meyer; "they are drunk in
the streets and taverns of Weissheim."
</p>

<p>
"Then I am going where my men ought to be," said
Karl.  "If we can gather a sufficient body of sober
men to hold Redoubt A, we can at least foil any attempt
of Bernhardt's to rush the town in the dead of night."
</p>

<p>
"An admirable idea," said Meyer rising with the
others, "and one which I was going to suggest myself.
I can manage a searchlight, and Von Bilderbaum can
train a <i>mitrailleuse</i>, and Herr Saunders can order a
company of riflemen&mdash;if he can find them."
</p>

<p>
"Come," said Karl, making towards the door, "let
us waste no time!"
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty," said Mrs. Saunders, speaking
with some hesitation, "this morning I asked my
husband to let me accompany him to the Marienkastel.
He refused, and with reason.  But there is no danger
in your quest to-night.  I am not asking you to let
me help guard the redoubts, but to use a woman's
influence in obtaining recruits for your garrison."
</p>

<p>
"Bravely spoken!" said Karl.  "Wrap yourself well
in furs, dear lady, and come with us.  Bilderbaum can
swear, and Meyer can sneer, but a beautiful woman can
compel by surer means."
</p>

<p>
"If Frau Saunders goes, I will go too," said the
wife of General Bilderbaum.  "I will shake these
drunken soldiers into a sense of discipline, or I am not
the wife of the bravest soldier in your Majesty's army."
</p>

<p>
The party of six sallied forth into the night.  The
snow had ceased falling, and the haze of clouds had
drifted southwards, leaving the black dome of night
clean and clear and jewelled with the steely brilliance
of the winter stars.  Through the courtyard they
strode, over the squeaking snow, past the sentinels in
their black and yellow boxes with their charcoal
braziers, past the great piers of the entrance with their
fantastic caps of overhanging snow, and as they went
the sounds of revelry assailed their ears with louder
note.
</p>

<p>
"Dissipation is the better part of valour," was
Meyer's sneering comment, as the refrain of riotous
song floated on the thin air.  "It is so easy to be
brave when the red wine is well within range, and the
ammunition of the <i>bier-halle</i> is inexhaustible."
</p>

<p>
In the road were groups of men, soldiers and civilians,
with linked arms, reeling gait, and a gift for making
the night hideous with tuneless song.
</p>

<p>
Within fifty yards of the palace a bonfire had been
kindled, and round its ruddy flames a wild dance, a
veritable <i>carmagnole</i> of drunken triumph, was in
progress.  Here the royal party stopped to watch, and in
a few minutes they were recognised.
</p>

<p>
"Hail, Karl the Twenty-second of Grimland!"
cried a big-bearded man in a military overcoat.  "Long
live our gallant King!"
</p>

<p>
"Three cheers for Karl!" cried another, a burly
form well muffled in a gigantic green ulster.  "Death
to the revolutionaries!"
</p>

<p>
Karl saluted gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Your sentiments are admirable, sirs," he said.  "It
would be perhaps even nobler if you put them into
practice."
</p>

<p>
"I have been in the firing-line all day," answered the
first speaker, "and Bernhardt and his men are two
leagues from here by now."
</p>

<p>
"They may not be so in the small hours of the
morning," said Meyer.  "If they take it into their
heads to return, they will have an easy task to
overcome an army of sots."
</p>

<p>
The dance had ceased for the moment.  The majority
stood at a little distance from the royal party,
ashamed to pursue their orgy, but resentful of its
interruption.  Two other figures, however, arm in arm,&mdash;as
if to steady their unruly footsteps,&mdash;joined the
group.  One of them,&mdash;a small man with a big blonde
moustache,&mdash;was clad in the uniform of a private.  The
other was wrapped in a sheepskin overall and had a
woollen helmet pulled down over his ears and chin.
The latter raised a guttural voice in husky protest.
</p>

<p>
"It is hard if we cannot celebrate your Majesty's
victory in our own way!" he hiccupped.  "A glass or
two of wine hurts no man on a cold night like this."  He
steadied himself against the small soldier.
</p>

<p>
"Frantz will be all right in half an hour," said the
bearded one confidently.  "He has had but two or three
cups of Kurdesheim, and his head is not over-strong.
A few more dances round the bonfire and he will be as
sober as any of us."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, my merry gentlemen," said Meyer.
"You seem to me to be only partially drunk, and a
brisk walk down to the forts would probably render
you tolerably sober.  If you will stand by us to-night
and help us guard the town till daylight you shall
be drunk for a week on end at the King's expense&mdash;I
swear it on the honour of a Jew."
</p>

<p>
"That's well spoken," said the bearded man pensively.
"I like to get jolly now and again, but I don't
want to see those d&mdash;&mdash;d Weidenbruckers stealing a
march on us when we're in our cups.  I'm for the
King, I am, and to the devil with the Schattenbergs!"
</p>

<p>
"But to-morrow there will be no sport afoot," objected
the man in the green ulster, "and to-night there
will be grand fun in the 'Drei Kronen' and outside the
Meierei."
</p>

<p>
A murmur of agreement came from the others.
</p>

<p>
"They say they're going to burn Father Bernhardt
in effigy," said the fellow in the woollen helmet, "and
that there will be free beer at the 'Drei Kronen.'  The
beer at the 'Drei Kronen' is good&mdash;very good."
</p>

<p>
It was Mrs. Saunders who spoke next.
</p>

<p>
"I think these men are quite right," she said coolly.
"They have probably seen a little fighting from a distance,
and are quite satisfied with that.  They evidently
prefer the smell of beer to the smell of gunpowder, and
would be quite useless if there was serious work to do
in the forts."
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" demanded the bearded man, in a
sudden access of indignation.  "We afraid!  My
father was a soldier, and so was my grandfather, and
I have served his Majesty twelve years come Michaelmas,
and one doesn't serve twelve years in the army of
Grimland without learning something about ball
cartridges.  Afraid!  Bah!  I'd sooner spend a night in
the trenches potting at old Bernhardt and his friends
than drink the best brandy in the cellars of the
Brunvarad."
</p>

<p>
"An admirable sentiment," said Meyer, "but one not
apparently shared by your comrade in the green
ulster."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I like fighting well enough," replied the
individual in question, "only it is cold work doing
sentry-go when there's no enemy within six miles of you."
</p>

<p>
"For shame!" cried Mrs. Saunders.  "Is your idea
of military service the mere excitement of fine-weather
fighting?  Is not <i>duty</i> among your ideals as well as
<i>glory</i>?  We so far mistrust this retreat of Bernhardt's
that we are going to Redoubt A to watch against any
return of the rebuffed Weidenbruckers.  Must we go
alone,&mdash;four men who are wearied with long hours of
anxiety and ceaseless activity, and two women who have
never handled a rifle in their existence?  Is that your
creed of loyalty, your standard of a soldier's honour?"
</p>

<p>
"Rudolf," said the man in the ulster to the gentleman
with the beard, "we must accompany our good
sovereign and his friends to the fort.  The lady is right.
Duty is duty, and the beer of the 'Drei Kronen' can
wait.  I would have liked a dance outside the Meierei,
but&mdash;&mdash;" here he wiped an eye with the sleeve of his
ulster&mdash;"I am a man of honour&mdash;and the beer will
keep."
</p>

<p>
"Forward then!" said Meyer, striking while the iron
was hot.  "Down the hill to Redoubt A, and gather
what recruits we can in the name of duty&mdash;and
postponed beer."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
<br><br>
"A SURPRISE"
</h3>

<p>
Onward they tramped in silence down the road towards
the lower town, and as they went the half-moon pushed
its gleaming disc through the melting curtain of cloud,
and made of the night a frozen picture of fantastic
beauty.  To their right the snows of the Trau-altar
and Eizenzahn streamed in silver floods towards the
glistening plain, where, a full thousand feet below, the
village of Riefinsdorf proclaimed itself with cheerful
points of golden light.
</p>

<p>
The sounds of revelry grew distant, and the silence
of the sleeping hills made itself felt.  It was a prospect
of unreal beauty, a duo-tone of violet-black and fairy
silver, an impression of eerie shadows and unearthly
light.
</p>

<p>
Saunders and his wife walked hand in hand.  The
day had brought them very close together, and they
were well content.  Soon a shuffling sound was heard,
and a turn of the road disclosed a body of troops on
skis ascending the hill from the opposite direction.  The
King's party halted in the middle of the way, and
Meyer accosted the officer at their head.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you, sir?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Fifteenth Light Infantry," was the reply.  "I am
Captain Lexa, and we are returning from pursuing the
enemy, according to orders."
</p>

<p>
Meyer cast his eye over the officer's command.
There seemed about a hundred and fifty to two hundred
riflemen, of whom a good score bore tokens of recent
fighting.  A few serious cases were covered with rugs,
and were being pulled on small sleighs.  A further
inspection disclosed a number of prisoners in the centre,
with hands roped behind their backs.
</p>

<p>
"You got into touch, I see," Meyer pursued.
</p>

<p>
"We pressed them closely," answered the Captain,
"and at first so eager was their retreat that they
abandoned all their guns one after another.  Further
away they rallied, and though they continued to retreat,
they easily held us at bay, and went off at their
own pace."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think they mean coming back?" asked Karl.
</p>

<p>
"No, sire.  When we got orders to return they
were six or seven kilometres beyond Riefinsdorf; and
though we waited and watched them for at least half
an hour, they continued to increase the distance, till
they were lost to sight in the gloom and the snow."
</p>

<p>
"They're not the right stuff, those Weidenbruckers,"
said Von Bilderbaum.  "They can only play a winning
game.  I don't think we shall see their faces again
this winter."
</p>

<p>
"But what of Von Hügelweiler?" demanded Meyer.
"He was in command of the pursuit.  Has he been hit
by the enemy?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Then why in heaven's name does he not return
with you?" persisted the Commander-in-Chief.  "Has
he been loyal for long enough to one side?  Or does he,
like Cato, prefer to espouse the losing side?"
</p>

<p>
Captain Lexa hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"I think he was mad," he said at length.  "When
your <i>aide</i> brought the order of recall, Captain
Hügelweiler swore that he had been sent to pursue and would
continue to pursue as long as his legs carried his body,
and his arms a rifle.  The <i>aide</i> backed his orders with
the King's name, but Hügelweiler harangued his men
and bade all such as loved the good game of war follow
him to the bitter end.  An impossible position was
created, and the <i>aide-de-camp</i> ordered Von Hügelweiler's
arrest.  Before, however, the order could be put
into execution, the mutinous captain was ski-ing down
a steep snow slope in the direction of the enemy."
</p>

<p>
"You should have fired on him," said Bilderbaum.
</p>

<p>
"I gave the order, sir, but the men hesitated.  Some
of them had served with him earlier in the day, when he
had displayed the most reckless courage.  Besides, his
refusal to halt, seeming rather an excess of gallantry
than an act of mutiny, touched their imagination, and
the few shots that rang out left him unscathed.  Then
the <i>aide-de-camp</i>, losing his patience, snatched a rifle
from one of my units, knelt down in the snow, and
brought down the Captain with a well-directed shot."
</p>

<p>
"And was he killed?" asked Saunders not unfeelingly.
</p>

<p>
"I think so.  If not, he is dead by now, for he was
badly hit, and the frost does not spare a man when he
is bleeding from an open wound."
</p>

<p>
"Captain Lexa," said Karl, "you seem a capable
and zealous officer, but your task is not over yet.  It
may be,&mdash;as you and General von Bilderbaum think,&mdash;that
the Weidenbruckers have had enough hammering
for a season, and have no intention of returning.  But
Meyer thinks otherwise, nor am I one to leave matters
to chance.  Bernhardt is a madman who is not subject
to the ordinary influences of disaster.  His lieutenant,
Trafford, is a man of exceptional ability and resource.
They are not likely, in my opinion, to acquiesce in a
discredited return to the capital."
</p>

<p>
"They cannot be back at Weissheim for some hours
yet, sire," said the Captain.
</p>

<p>
"I know.  But our men are debauched with victory.
They are out of hand.  They have done their day's
work, and they want to enjoy the price of their labours.
You, Captain, seem a sober, honest soldier with a firm
hold over your command.  Can I trust you,&mdash;when you
have rested your men and seen to their rations,&mdash;to
return in an hour's time to Redoubt A to watch with
us against a surprise attack from our enemies?"
</p>

<p>
"You may trust me to the death, sire," said the
young officer with emotion, "and for every man of my
command whom I fail to bring to the redoubt I will
forfeit a year's promotion."
</p>

<p>
"Well spoken, Captain Lexa," said Karl with a
smile.  "While there are men like you in my army
I can never despair of my fortunes."
</p>

<p>
The King and his little party stood at the edge of
the road while the regiment resumed its upward progress.
Lithe, sunburned men, untired by the long day's
work, they glided swiftly by, one and all saluting as
they passed the royal presence, and ultimately breaking
into a shrill cheer as they vanished up the zig-zagging
road.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God for brave men!" said Karl simply,
when they had gone.
</p>

<p>
"We shall not need our friends here after all," said
Saunders, referring to the quartet they had enticed
from the festive bonfire.
</p>

<p>
"Aye," said the man with the beard.  "You may
want us yet.  They are gallant fellows, those soldier
lads, but they will be tempted up yonder, and the true
Grimlander ever meets temptation half way."
</p>

<p>
"They will not fail me," said Karl, whose optimism
seemed to have returned in full force.  "My fortunes
have turned, and I have no fears of their staunchness."
</p>

<p>
"Still it would be prudent to take these gentlemen
with us," said Meyer.  "Lexa and his men may be
late, and there will be plenty for them to do."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we are coming," pursued the bearded man.
"I, too, believe Bernhardt means returning, and I
would give ten years of my life to put a bullet through
his wicked skull.  As for the Princess Gloria, I would
not spare that wanton little&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush, man!" interrupted Karl.  "The Princess is
a relative of mine."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, and one to be proud of!" went on the man
defiantly.  "They say that she and the American
Trafford&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind what they say," said Karl sternly.
"The Princess is a wild, irresponsible girl, but she is
as free from grossness as the snows of the Eizenzahn."
</p>

<p>
"They say&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Silence!" thundered Karl passionately, raising an
arm as if to strike the speaker across the mouth.  "I
have known her since she was a tiny child, and though
she has rebel blood in her veins, she is as clean and
wholesome as a Weissheim night."
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty is generous," said Von Bilderbaum.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe," assented Karl, "but I think we all share
the same fault where the Princess Irresponsible is
concerned.  I, who have seen her grow from a beautiful
child into a lovely woman, have still a soft corner in my
heart for her; even when her schemings were most
alarmingly successful I could never summon hate to
my aid in my battle against her.  And to-night, when
fortune smiles upon me, I could wish to take her small
hand in mine and read her a lesson on the iniquity
of trying to dethrone one's first cousin once removed."
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty is sentimental," said Meyer.
</p>

<p>
"It is natural to be so on such a night as this,"
was the King's reply.  "This still, deep cold should
freeze the cynicism even out of your nature.  If the
Princess fights she must be fought, and she must accept
the fortune of war.  But when this half-tipsy ruffian
casts aspersions on her purity&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hear, hear!" broke in the man in the green ulster.
"Shoot the Princess if necessary, but spare her good
name.  I, in my humble way, am a great admirer of
the pretty little Gloria.  She has an eye that laughs,
and as sweet a pair of lips as a poor carpenter like me
may dare clap eyes upon.  The devil I want to harry
is the American Trafford, who mixes up with matters
that don't concern him, and brings fire and sword into
a poor country that has plenty of troubles already.
We've vermin of our own, goodness knows, but this
foreign weasel&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Karl was in a mood to hear ill of no man.  He
was convinced,&mdash;as he said,&mdash;that his fortunes had
turned.  His natural generosity was in the ascendant,
and the magic of the glorious night had won him to a
temper of broad benevolence.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Trafford," he laughed, "Providence watches
over men like that.  They take risks and thrive on them.
The bullet is not moulded that will pierce his tough
American skin; and I rejoice to think it is so, for he is
a most fascinating free lance.  He saved me from death
in the courtyard of the Neptunburg, and I have not
forgotten the debt.  Given a state of peace, and I
would have him as my guest in the Brunvarad to discuss
old battles over my best Tokay."
</p>

<p>
They had reached the place where the bob-sleigh
track crossed the highway,&mdash;a point of the run much
dreaded by the steersmen of racing crews.
</p>

<p>
"If we follow the path that borders the run," said
the bearded man, "we shall save a quarter of a mile
at least."
</p>

<p>
"That's true," said Meyer, "but the ladies must be
careful where they plant their feet.  If they step off
the beaten track they will be up to their waists in soft
snow."
</p>

<p>
"There is a moon," said the man in the ulster
curtly, climbing over the snow bank and leading the
way along the firm but narrow track.  The others
followed in single file, and for a time nothing was heard
but the crunching of snow beneath their feet.  For a
space their progress lay among pine-trees, through
whose black trunks and freshly-silvered branches the
moonlight streamed in rays of elfish light.  With its
mysterious shadows and sharp silences the wood seemed
a vast natural treasure house, wherein the frost jewels
gleamed with rich profusion and the strange radiance
of an enchanted dreamland.  To walk with open eyes
in such scenes was to lose touch with reality, to forget
the sway and swirl of things material, the harsh
absurdities of Grimland's civic strife.  No wonder a silence
fell on the pacing line.
</p>

<p>
The awakening was rude.  As they emerged from
the many pillared sanctuary of the forest there was a
loud cry of "Now!"  Someone, a man in a woollen
helmet, threw a cloak around Karl's head and shoulders;
someone, a man with a thick beard, struck Saunders
heavily in the face, so that he fell back from the firm
path into the yielding depth of the untrodden snow.
At the same moment Von Bilderbaum, hastening to the
King's rescue, was tripped up by the man in the green
ulster, and measured his length violently on the hard
path.  Meyer, quick as thought, whipped out a
revolver and fired point blank between the shoulders
of Bilderbaum's assailant.  Frau von Bilderbaum
screamed, and in her emotion stepped off the firm path
and disappeared backwards into a sea of incohesive
crystals.  Before Meyer had time to fire again a man
was at his throat, a man with a beard hanging
grotesquely from one ear, a man with mad passion in his
eye and a nameless oath on his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Bernhardt!" gasped Meyer, fighting with the
frenzy of a terror-stricken man.  His assailant was his
superior in weight and vigour, but fortunately for the
Commander-in-Chief had but the use of one arm.
Nevertheless, the arm that fought him was a limb of steel,
the fingers of the sound member as relentless as the
tentacles of a devil fish.  The Jew sweated and struggled
like a man in a nightmare.  For a moment, choked
and breathless, he was overborne; then relief came.
Bilderbaum had regained his feet; the old soldier's
sword was drawn from its scabbard, and the ex-priest
hissed his last shuddering blasphemy into the night
air.
</p>

<p>
"Robert, Robert, are you hurt?" asked Mrs. Saunders,
in dire distress, of her struggling spouse, who was
making heroic efforts to wade through the waist-deep
snow to the <i>terra firma</i> of the trodden path.
</p>

<p>
"Karl&mdash;quick!" urged the breathless Englishman,
at length making his voice heard now that the struggle
was terminated.
</p>

<p>
They looked where Karl had been&mdash;and there was
no one.  The man in the woollen helmet, too, had
disappeared, and the short individual in the private's
uniform was likewise nowhere to be seen.
</p>

<p>
"A bob-sleigh,"&mdash;explained Saunders, still short of
breath, regaining with assistance the coveted foothold
of the path,&mdash;"they pushed him on to a bob-sleigh
which was anchored to the bough of a fir-tree.  The
little soldier man took the helm, and the other sat
guarding the King with a revolver in one hand and the
brake-lever in the other."
</p>

<p>
"After them!" cried old Bilderbaum excitedly, letting
go his wife's hand so that she relapsed again into
the treacherous quagmire of mocking powder.  "After
them!"
</p>

<p>
"After them!" repeated Meyer scornfully, rubbing
his bruised throat.  "We might do an heroic eight
miles an hour down this slippery path.  <i>They</i> will be
going forty, at least.  We might as well chase the
moonbeams!"
</p>

<p>
"What are we to do?" asked Saunders desperately.
</p>

<p>
"That is a question that fools always ask themselves
when their folly finds them out," returned Meyer
bitterly.  "Unfortunately there is no answer to it."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
<br><br>
THE CONQUERING KING
</h3>

<p>
"Brake!"  called a high feminine voice, issuing
strangely from the moustached lips of the soldier who
steered the abducting bob-sleigh.
</p>

<p>
The gentleman in the woollen helmet applied the
brake, and a sharp turn in the run was negotiated in
safety.
</p>

<p>
"How is Karl?" asked the Princess Gloria, for it
was she who was manipulating the wheel at the "bob's"
prow.
</p>

<p>
"Coming to, I think!" Trafford shouted back;
"this cold air would restore a corpse."
</p>

<p>
They were in the straight now, and the pace was
terrific.  Downward they tore through realms of icy
air, while the night wind pushed at their throats,
brought floods of moisture to their eyes, and roared
a wild melody in their deafened ears.  It was an
exhilarating experience, and even without the added
excitement of their desperate deed would have set the
blood racing in their veins.  But with the excitement
was mingled a very definite sense of shame, in Trafford's
case at any rate.  Their action had been justified by
success, and morally, perhaps, by its absolute necessity
in their desperate plight, but it painfully resembled
an act of treachery.
</p>

<p>
"What became of Father Bernhardt and Doctor
Matti?" asked Gloria presently.
</p>

<p>
Trafford leaned forward and answered at the top of
his voice:
</p>

<p>
"They must have been killed!  Our weight started
the 'bob' before I intended, and we were a hundred
yards down the track before I could get my hand to
the brake.  It was impossible to go back."
</p>

<p>
"Will they catch us, do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!  We are travelling at the rate of an
express train.  Another twenty minutes of this, and
we shall reach the point where Colonel Schale's flying
detachment has arranged to wait for us."
</p>

<p>
For a while they travelled without further speech,
save when an imperious "Brake!" from the Princess
indicated that the pace must be checked in order for
a corner to be rounded without mishap.
</p>

<p>
Under the stone viaduct of the railway they flew,
winding in and out of pine woods, sometimes catching
a glimpse of the golden lights of Riefinsdorf, and
sometimes of the moonlit ivory of the mighty
Klauigberg.
</p>

<p>
"You are sure that Father Bernhardt and Dr. Matti
must have been killed?" asked Gloria at length.
</p>

<p>
"Without reasonable doubt.  They have gone to
their long homes, which, according to all theory, should
be widely separated.  That's as may be.  The man
I'm sorry for is poor Karl, who was feeling really happy
till I clapped the drugged antimacassar over his
head."
</p>

<p>
Trafford waited to hear his sentiments echoed, but
Gloria said nothing.  Her silence pained him; under the
circumstances it seemed ungenerous.
</p>

<p>
Then occurred something which cannot be verbally
described,&mdash;so far as the sensations of the three human
beings were concerned; for, to be suddenly checked in
a lightning descent and hurled incontinently into deep
snow, produces a complexity of emotions incapable of
being recorded through the medium of ink.  What
happened to the bob-sleigh is a matter of more precise
fact.  The front part struck violently against some
hard object, the steering runners were wrenched round
at right angles to the body of the sleigh, the whole
thing skidded viciously on the ice, and finally buried
its nose in the flanking wall of snow.
</p>

<p>
"Are you hurt, Gloria?" called out Trafford from
his couch of crystals, as soon as he had sufficient breath
to frame the question.
</p>

<p>
There was no answer.  Within a few yards of him
Karl was sitting up with an expression of dazed
bewilderment that was almost comic to behold.  Trafford
rose and made his way with infinite difficulty to the
run.  Discovering his revolver lying by the side of the
track, he picked it up and examined it.  It was
uninjured and the cartridges still undetonated.
</p>

<p>
"Gloria!" he called.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;I'm all right," came a voice somewhere from
the neighbourhood of Karl.  "I'm only a bit shaken.
I couldn't answer before.  I hadn't&mdash;any&mdash;breath."
</p>

<p>
"No bones broken?" he persisted.
</p>

<p>
"None whatever.  What happened?"
</p>

<p>
Trafford was peering thoughtfully at the track.
</p>

<p>
"Curling-stones," he answered laconically.  "When
we enfiladed Saunders' trench we sent Major Flannel's
stones on a long journey&mdash;but not long enough, it
appears.  There has been a small avalanche of snow
across the track, due, I presume, to the vibration of
the guns.  This held the stones up in the middle of the
fair-way.  We might have ploughed through the snow,
but the granite smashed us."
</p>

<p>
"What's to be done?" asked the Princess after a pause.
</p>

<p>
Trafford stepped over the snow-bank and examined
the "bob."  The runners were twisted and half
wrenched from the wooden framework.  The steering-wheel
was jammed, and refused to respond to the most
strenuous efforts; the brake-lever was snapped off short.
</p>

<p>
"The midnight express doesn't run any further," he said.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth are we to do?"
</p>

<p>
He answered her question with another.
</p>

<p>
"How's Karl?"
</p>

<p>
The outraged monarch replied in person.
</p>

<p>
"I am tolerably well, thank you," he said.  "I have
been conscious for some time, and have listened with
some amusement to your commiserations of my lot.
The little catastrophe which has just occurred has
dispelled the last lingering fumes of the chloroform with
which you rendered me <i>hors de combat</i>."
</p>

<p>
Trafford said nothing, but knitted his brows in
perplexed thought.
</p>

<p>
"We are face to face with a very serious problem,"
he said after a full minute's meditation.  "Gloria, are
you sufficiently recovered to join me on the path here,
or shall I come and help you out of the soft snow?"
</p>

<p>
"I will come to you," she answered, suiting the action
to the word, and ploughing her deep way to his side.
The blonde moustache had parted company with her
fair lips, and her fallen shako had released a charming
disorder of dark tresses.  In her great overcoat, her
nether extremities concealed in the snow, she looked once
more what she really was,&mdash;a young girl of singularly
fascinating aspect.
</p>

<p>
"We can't stay here all night," she said, when she
had won her way to the path, "and we cannot well
reach the spot where Colonel Schale is awaiting us."
</p>

<p>
Trafford shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Assuming we could walk so far," he said, "and
assuming our friend over there would consent to
accompany us, we should be overtaken by the pursuit
party they are bound to send after us."
</p>

<p>
"It's all hopeless," she said wearily.
</p>

<p>
"You have lost confidence in my ability to help you
out of difficulties?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"You are resourceful&mdash;indomitable almost," she
conceded, "but you cannot fight Fate."
</p>

<p>
"I am not trying to."
</p>

<p>
"But I am.  Had it not been for this wretched mishap
everything would have been splendid; we should
have returned to Weidenbruck with Karl our prisoner.
I should have been firmly established on my throne, and
you&mdash;&mdash;" she broke off suddenly and added a little
sadly: "As it is, we are checkmated within sight of
victory."
</p>

<p>
"You do not blame me for your disappointment?
You concede that I did my best?"
</p>

<p>
His question was dispassionate.  She answered it
with generous words, but without enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"You did more than any other man could have done.
Indeed, I am not complaining of you; I am complaining
of Fate."
</p>

<p>
"Personally, I have a pathetic and unconquerable
confidence in Fate," he retorted.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;yes.  But what is my position?  Bernhardt
is dead, Matti is dead, Karl is our prisoner only so
long as he consents to be.  You and I are alone,&mdash;alone
in the dead of night, in a land of snow and frost.
We must find shelter, or perish.  We must creep down
to Riefinsdorf for a night's lodging, for the road to
Wallen is long and will be traversed, for a certainty,
by our pursuers.  Do you not see now why I complain
of Fate?  Lying slander has coupled our names none
too pleasantly before; what will it say when it has
visual facts instead of idle gossip to build upon?"
</p>

<p>
"Slander will say a good deal," he replied, "but if
we wish to give it the lie, the register of the Chapel
Royal can always retort with an unanswerable
argument."
</p>

<p>
Gloria said nothing.  Moonlight, which is infinitely
more beautifying than sunlight, had put a strange fire
into her eyes, and turned her flesh to clearest ivory.
Trafford, had he been a heathen, would have bowed
down and worshipped, so goddess-like was her still pose,
so unearthly the cold, soft shadows that gave roundness
to her cheeks.  As it was, he held his breath and
clenched his hands in a spasm of passionate appreciation.
Was ever anything so fair under the stars, he
asked himself?&mdash;did ever such mystic fire burn in human
eyes, or frosty breath issue from such perfectly-shaped
lips?
</p>

<p>
In another instant, however, Trafford unclasped his
hands, and his fingers trembled, for a great wrath had
suddenly mastered him and was shaking his frame as a
winter tempest shakes the dead bough of a blasted tree.
Gloria,&mdash;his Gloria,&mdash;who might have loved, who might
have fulfilled the mission of her splendid womanhood,
had fought down the promptings of her heart and given
herself to ambition and the deadening lust of place and
power.  He felt an almost overpowering desire to seize
her roughly in his arms, to break her in his grasp, to
crush the supple limbs in an act of ferocious but just
retribution.  Fortunately his brain steadied itself in
time, the mad impulse was checked, and,&mdash;as was the
way with him,&mdash;the paroxysm gave place to a singularly
clear and controlled condition of mind.
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty," he called out to Karl, who was
still maintaining a recumbent position in the snow, "are
you sufficiently recovered from your various mishaps
to join us here on the path and discuss the situation?"
</p>

<p>
For answer Karl struggled to his feet and made
towards them.  He appeared very pale in the moonlight,
but there was the same look in his eyes as when
he had faced the rebel throng in the courtyard of the
Neptunburg.
</p>

<p>
"You perceive our difficulties, of course," Trafford
began.  "A week ago we set out from Weidenbruck
to accomplish a certain object: that object was, in
plain language, to wipe you off the earth, or bring you
back bound to the capital.  We employed open force,
and failed.  We employed the gentle arts of abduction,
and succeeded&mdash;up to a point."
</p>

<p>
Karl nodded.  "I follow you," he said curtly.
</p>

<p>
"Our motives were frankly selfish," Trafford went
on.  "The favour of the good Weidenbruckers had
to be retained, and it was necessary to do something
notable to obtain permanent possession of their good
graces."  He paused a moment, toyed with his revolver,
and looked fixedly at Gloria and then back again at
Karl.  Then he went on deliberately: "If we return
without having killed or captured one, Karl, styling
himself King of Grimland, we shall be returning to a
nest of hornets.  You see my point?"
</p>

<p>
Karl eyed the revolver thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I see your point," he said; "I saw it long
before you put it before me.  Having failed to abduct
me, only one course is open to you.  Here I am,
unarmed, alone, scarcely recovered from an anæsthetic,
shaken by a fall.  The moon gives ample light, and
your revolver is loaded."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely," said Trafford.  "My course is so
obvious!  A pressure of the first finger, a puff of smoke,
and a brave man groaning in the snow!  There are but
two objections: firstly, I am not a butcher; secondly,
you took it upon you a little while ago to defend the
honour of my wife!"
</p>

<p>
"Your wife?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  The lady who is now more or less disguised
as a private of the line, did me the honour of bestowing
on me her hand in the Chapel Royal of the Neptunburg.
When Bernhardt,&mdash;playing his part,&mdash;hinted at her
shame, your kingly spirit refused to hear ill even of your
enemy.  For that,&mdash;if for no other reason,&mdash;I am
steering clear of regicide."
</p>

<p>
Karl passed his hand across his brow, as if the news
was too much for his dazed senses.
</p>

<p>
"You and Gloria von Schattenberg are man and
wife?" he gasped.
</p>

<p>
"On paper," Trafford affirmed, "on paper only.  In
reality we are nothing to each other, and as events are
turning out, never will be anything to each other.
But I am a proud man, proud of the secret bond
between us, though our vows were meaningless and of no
value; and because you took it upon you to defend the
honour of my 'paper' spouse, I give you your life
and wish you God-speed."
</p>

<p>
Karl's features twitched in the moonlight, and his
breath seemed to come with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
"You are a generous foeman," he said at length.
</p>

<p>
"Not more so than yourself," Trafford retorted.
"When I,&mdash;also playing my part,&mdash;swore death to 'the
cursed American Trafford,' you vowed you would like
me for a guest, with whom to fight old battles over old
Tokay.  I am fond of Tokay," Trafford went on, "and
I am fond of reminiscences; also I know a man when I
see one.  Karl, King of Grimland, will you give me
your hand?"
</p>

<p>
Karl stretched out his hand and gripped the other's.
He seemed searching for words, but no words came.
</p>

<p>
Trafford read many things in the labouring chest
and the dimmed eye, and his heart kindled.
</p>

<p>
"You call me generous," he went on, "but I am
generous with another's property.  Grimland is yours
or Gloria's; mine it never was.  Fate has somehow set
me as umpire in a great quarrel; and being holder of
the scales I must perforce be impartial.  Supposing I
trample conscience under foot and do a nameless deed
under the moon: suppose we return to Weidenbruck
triumphant as Queen and consort, what then?
Bernhardt, who understood the temper of the Grimland
<i>canaille</i>, who ruled them as a rough huntsman rules a
pack of hounds&mdash;Bernhardt the apostate, the
<i>absintheur</i>, the distorted genius whose counsels could
alone have kept us in power&mdash;is no more.  Matti is
dead&mdash;Matti who, as city prefect, did more with his
reforming zeal to make the name of Schattenberg stink
in the nostrils of the citizens than any enemy could
have done.  Weidenbruck is yours for the asking!
The nobility were never against you; the people were
ours only in their meaner moments.  You left the
capital as a fugitive; you will return as conquerer, and
the people will cry, as I cry now: 'Long live Karl the
Twenty-second, of Grimland!'"
</p>

<p>
Still Karl maintained his frozen silence; not a muscle
of his face moved.  Only, there was a gleam in his eyes
that seemed to look beyond the stark pine trunks and
the barren fields of snow; that seemed to project his
vision over forty leagues of hill and plain to the
turbulent city on the Niederkessel, where a shouting throng
acclaimed him as their King.  For a moment his whole
face lit up with a wonderful glow, and then his emotion
seemed to master him.  He was a strong man, but he
had been through much, physically and mentally, and
the last sudden vicissitude of his fortunes won a sharp
reaction.  His heart beat in great thuds, and the stiff
vertical trunks of the forest pines bent and swayed
before his eyes.  He leaned against a big tree and
covered his face with his hands.
</p>

<p>
Trafford turned and faced Gloria.  He expected
reproaches, anger, tears of despair.  He had given away
her kingdom to her enemy.  The strong plant of her
ambition he had cut at the very tap-root.  He who,
by hardening his heart, might have made her a queen,
had preferred by an act of mercy to make her a fugitive!
He steeled himself against the expected hurricane
of bitterness.  He looked, and as he looked he rubbed
his eyes in amazement.  The face of Gloria von Schattenberg
was the face he had seen in delirium at the old
house at Wallen,&mdash;the face of a woman with a loving
heart and a soul of flame.  The eyes that met his were
bright with a splendid joy, overflowing with a great
tenderness.
</p>

<p>
"Gloria!"
</p>

<p>
She advanced towards him with outstretched arms,
a smile on her lips.
</p>

<p>
He seized her and drew her to him.
</p>

<p>
"Have I done right?" he whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Beloved, a thousand times, yes!"  she replied.
"To-night I see things truly, and I shall never see them
otherwise.  You have conquered me, hypnotised me, as
you nearly did at Wallen; and now there is no
Bernhardt to wake me from my sweet dream.  The glory
of a man is his strength and his courage, but the heart
of a man is his tenderness and his mercy, and it is these
that have prevailed with me."
</p>

<p>
"Herr Trafford!" came a voice from the big pine-tree.
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty."
</p>

<p>
"I am going to make my way back to Weissheim.
May I ask what you propose doing?"
</p>

<p>
Trafford hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"About that I must consult the Princess," he said
at length.
</p>

<p>
"I am going where my husband goes," said Gloria,
"and I am doing what my husband decides to do."
</p>

<p>
"Then we will make for Riefinsdorf," said Trafford.
"To-morrow, early, we will get a smith to mend our
shattered 'bob,' and before the sun has climbed above
the shoulder of the Klauigberg we will be scudding
down the King's highway, 'Youth at the prow and
pleasure at the helm.'"
</p>

<p>
"Towards Wallen?" asked Karl.
</p>

<p>
"Towards Austria," corrected Trafford.  "The
road forks at Winterthurm, and we take the southern
branch.  The Rylvio Pass is steep, and six hours'
coasting should bring us to the frontier."
</p>

<p>
"Needless to say, you need fear no pursuit," said
Karl, "but when will you return?  You have to be
my guest at the Brunvarad and drink my wine.  That
is part of the bargain."
</p>

<p>
Trafford smiled.
</p>

<p>
"It may come to that, some day," he said.  "Things
move quickly in Grimland.  But the time is not yet."  He
paused, and then went on: "Your Majesty has had
an eventful winter.  You have lost a throne and
regained it, I believe, more firmly than before.  That is,
in allegory, the case with me"&mdash;he took the Princess's
hand in his&mdash;"and I am well content."
</p>

<p>
Karl gazed at the happy pair.  Slowly a wonderful
smile spread itself over his face, and his eyes shone
through a veil of moisture.  He seized Trafford's hand
and gripped it almost violently.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, brave and generous enemy!" he said;
"Good-bye, friend that is to be, that must be, that
shall be!"  He turned to the Princess, took her in
his big arms, and kissed her on both cheeks.  "Good-bye,
little cousin!" he said.  "You are wise and happy
in your choice.  You have abjured a troubled throne
for a kingdom of peace and heart's ease.  You are my
kinswoman in more than blood,&mdash;for you have given
yourself to the man whom I am proud to call friend."
</p>

<p>
He turned and walked up the path as one in a dream.
For a moment he staggered in his gait; but he stooped
down and rubbed some snow on his forehead, and went
on steadily up the hill towards Weissheim.
</p>

<p>
Gloria and Trafford stood watching him till he
disappeared from view.
</p>

<p>
A little sob broke from the Princess.  Then she put
her hand in Trafford's, and together they set out
towards Riefinsdorf.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
<br><br>
THE LOST SHEEP
</h3>

<p>
In the small hours of the morning, a party of half a
dozen men on skis issued from the courtyard of the
Brunvarad.  They were weary-looking folk, dull-eyed
and taciturn, and without a word they set themselves
in motion along the road to Riefinsdorf.  The remains
of a huge bonfire glowed dully by the roadside, and a
pillar of black smoke streamed straight up into the
windless air.  Where the snow had thawed in a circle
round the once festive blaze it had frozen again into
lumps of discoloured ice.  Dark, recumbent forms
showed here and there in the snow, heavy breathing
wretches who had gone to sleep, warmed with abundant
wine and the glowing flames, but who would wake in
the morn to the misery of frost-bite and its attendant
horrors.  But the little group of ski-ers had no thought
for such as these, and they passed them by with scarce
a glance.  Onward they went without a word, till
Meyer tripped up over a sleeping form in the roadway,
and broke the silence with a bitter curse, as he dragged
himself to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you go home, Meyer?"  suggested
Saunders, "you are fagged out, and we may have to
sprint later on."
</p>

<p>
"If Bilderbaum can go on, I can go on," said the
Commander-in-Chief irritably.  "He is ten years older
than I am."
</p>

<p>
"Five," corrected the General snappishly.
</p>

<p>
"The pursuit is farcical," said Meyer.  "It would
have been useless if we had undertaken it at once.  At
this hour it is a piece of ludicrous folly."
</p>

<p>
"You need not come," snapped Saunders, who, like
the others, seemed to be in the worst of humours.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," retorted Meyer.  "We must play the
game to its weary end.  We have shown ourselves fools,
and the least part of our penalty is a sleepless night
after a restless day."
</p>

<p>
"We may overtake them yet," said Captain Lexa,
who, with two of his riflemen, made up the little party.
</p>

<p>
"Impossibilities seem possibilities only to geniuses
and fools," said Meyer rudely.  "It is hardly necessary
to state to which category we belong."
</p>

<p>
"While there is life there is hope," maintained Lexa
stubbornly.
</p>

<p>
Meyer made an exclamation of contempt.
</p>

<p>
"Supposing the miracle is realised," he said, "and
the slower catches the swifter, even then they will
certainly outwit us again.  In the proverb the
tortoise caught the hare&mdash;but then the tortoise had
brains."
</p>

<p>
Meyer's sarcasm had anything but a cheering effect
on the dismal spirits of the company.
</p>

<p>
"To think of our never recognising them!" said
Saunders bitterly.  "To think of Trafford fooling
us&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Trafford has imagination and initiative, in
strong contradistinction to ourselves!" interrupted
Meyer.  "He has fooled us before and he would fool
us again twenty times if twenty opportunities were
offered him.  We are not very clever people, my dear
Saunders."
</p>

<p>
"If we are ever to catch them," said Lexa, "it
must be by taking every short cut that offers itself.
The road to Wallen winds round in and out of the
mountains, and our only chance of overtaking the
fugitives is to go straight up hill and down dale, no
matter how steep and difficult the track."
</p>

<p>
Meyer groaned.  His legs were aching intolerably,
and the thought of breasting a steep ascent on skis
almost overwhelmed his flagging spirit.  No one,
however, answered his groan with another suggestion that
he should go back.  The Jew had expressed his
determination to go on to the bitter end, and nothing
but complete physical collapse would stop him.  They
glissaded swiftly and almost recklessly down the
hillside, and the rush of keen air somewhat quickened
their flagging energies.
</p>

<p>
"Bend to the left!" called out Saunders, himself
executing a fine "Christiania swing," and thereby just
saving himself from charging the snow-wall that banked
the bob-sleigh run.  The others swung round at his
call, and for a time proceeded parallel to the track
at a reduced speed.
</p>

<p>
"Man ahead!" called out Saunders presently; and
true enough a dark object was advancing slowly
towards them up the path bordering the run.  The
two soldiers cuddled their rifles suggestively, and the
others proceeded at an even pace towards the strange
walker of the night.
</p>

<p>
"A wounded soldier finding his way back,"
suggested Lexa.
</p>

<p>
"He may be able to give us information," said Von
Bilderbaum.
</p>

<p>
"Or he may be going to shoot us," said Meyer,
prepared as usual for the worst.  "Hands up, man,"
he called nervously, "or we fire!"
</p>

<p>
The man slowly raised his hands above his head,
and continued to plod wearily up the path towards
them.  In the vague moonlight the newcomer seemed
of gigantic stature, and his soundless footsteps
suggested a being from another world.  On he came with
upraised arms and bent head, and then suddenly he
lifted his face so that the rays of the sinking moon
fell full upon it.
</p>

<p>
Lexa uttered a cry, but the others stood still in
frozen silence, believing they dreamed.  Then old
Bilderbaum called out hoarsely to the soldiers, "Present
arms!" and himself stood stiffly at the salute.
</p>

<p>
"Must I continue to hold my hands in the air?"
asked Karl.  "I am very tired."
</p>

<p>
"Your Majesty!" gasped Saunders.
</p>

<p>
"Good-evening, gentlemen," said the King, at
length lowering his arms.  "This is an unexpected
pleasure.  You are indefatigable."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me," said Meyer yawning; "we are
exceedingly tired.  But as I have been constantly
reminding my comrades,&mdash;almost to the point of
boredom,&mdash;we are a pack of fools and must pay for our
folly by the inconvenience of a night in the snow."
</p>

<p>
"If you are fools," said Karl, "I am the king of
fools.  But at least there is something noble in your
folly, if it leads you from warmth and shelter to a
hopeless search over a snow-bound countryside."
</p>

<p>
"But you have escaped, sire?" said Bilderbaum.
</p>

<p>
"Yes and no," replied Karl.  "When the grand
coup occurred on the bob-sleigh run I was partially
stupefied by the fumes of chloroform.  I quickly
recovered, however, from its effects, and was even
beginning to appreciate the fascinations of a moonlight
abduction when an accident occurred to the sleigh."
</p>

<p>
"You were hurt?"  inquired Saunders anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"No; I fell on my head&mdash;which is vastly harder
than the snow."
</p>

<p>
"What happened, sire?" asked Lexa.
</p>

<p>
And then the King went on to tell that when
Trafford enfiladed Saunders' trench with curling-stones
he had won the first trick in the game and
unwittingly lost the last.  That the stones went gaily
down the bob-sleigh run en route for Riefinsdorf, and
might have gone Heaven knows where had not a subsidence
of snow, caused doubtless by the reverberation
of the guns, blocked the track.  "The snow held the
stones up," he concluded, "and the Providence, which
manages the unstable affairs of kings and tobogganers,
arranged that our runners should strike a large pink
stone with a blue ribbon on it."
</p>

<p>
"Splendid!" cried Bilderbaum enthusiastically.
"The 'bob' was wrecked, and the Princess and
Trafford being stunned or disabled, you escaped from
their clutches."
</p>

<p>
"Your imagination does you infinite credit,
General," said Karl dryly, "but it outruns fact.  No one
was stunned or disabled; of the three, I was distinctly
the most shaken."
</p>

<p>
"But how&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The situation was simple," said Karl.  "The 'bob,'
as you surmise, was wrecked.  My abduction, therefore,
was rendered abortive.  There were only two
courses open to my enemies&mdash;to kill me and make their
way on foot to Wallen, where their friends were awaiting
them, or to set me free and themselves fly the country.
Those of you who know Trafford and his charming wife&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Wife!" interrupted Saunders.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," affirmed Karl; "the Princess Gloria was
secretly married some days ago to your friend
Trafford in the Chapel Royal of the Neptunburg.  They
are a healthy-minded couple, and they refused to
entertain seriously the idea of murder."
</p>

<p>
"They set you free!" ejaculated Saunders.  "Well
done, Nervy Trafford!  I am not so ashamed of my
friend after all."
</p>

<p>
"He is a splendid fellow," said Karl, "and incidentally,
my cousin by marriage.  I assure you I for my
part am not ashamed of the relationship."
</p>

<p>
"But where are they now?" asked Meyer.
</p>

<p>
"They are&mdash;where they are.  They are free to leave
the country without let or hindrance.  When things
are quieted down and I am firmly in the saddle again,
they can come back in their true capacity&mdash;as my
friends."
</p>

<p>
"We shall not have to wait long, sire," said Meyer
with an unwonted note of jubilation in his voice.  "Even
before yesterday's battle the tide was running strongly
for you at the capital.  Henceforth Weidenbruck and
the whole country will be loyal.  Long live Karl the
Twenty-second of Grimland!"
</p>

<p>
"Long live Karl!" echoed Saunders, Von Bilderbaum,
and Lexa.  "Long live Karl!" reiterated the
riflemen, raising their shakos aloft on their musket
barrels.
</p>

<p>
Karl stood still, with eyes that swam.  He began
to speak, but ended with a shake of his head, as if
something had choked him.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow, dear friends," he muttered very low.
"To-morrow.  To-night I am tired, very tired and
very happy.  Long live George Trafford and his
beautiful bride!" he said in stronger tones.  "God bless
them!  God bless our poor country!  God help me to
rule"&mdash;but his voice had sunk again to a whisper and
as he spoke he reeled against Saunders.
</p>

<p>
The latter held the massive but limp frame from
falling, while someone produced brandy from a flask
and poured a generous measure down the King's throat.
Then the soldiers made a seat of their crossed weapons,
and shoulder-high and supported by willing arms,
Karl of Grimland was borne, half-fainting with
exposure and fatigue, but serene of mind, to the winter
palace of his beloved Weissheim.

<h3>
EPILOGUE
</h3>

<P>
Down the great, white highway of the Rylvio Pass
a bob-sleigh was speeding in the early hours of a
perfect morning.  The incense of dawn was in the
air, and the magic of stupendous scenery uplifted the
souls of the two travellers.  Fantastic peaks of
incomparable beauty rose up in majesty to meet the
amazing turquoise of the heavens.  Sparkling cascades
of dazzling whiteness hung in streams of frozen
foam from dun cliffs and larch-crowned boulders.  The
roadway down which the sleigh was coursing with
unchecked speed wound like a silver ribbon at the edge
of precipices, sometimes tunnelling through an arch
of brown rock, only to give again, after a moment's
gloom, a fresh expanse of argent domes and
shimmering declivities.  Perched high on perilous crags
were ancient castles of grim battlements and enduring
masonry, stubborn homes of a stubborn nobility that
had levied toll in olden times on all such as passed
their inhospitable walls.  Below, in the still shadowed
valley, were villages of tiny houses, the toy campanili
of Lilliputian churches, and a grey-green river rushing
over a stony bed to merge itself in the ampler flood of
the Danube.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, could anything be more perfect?" asked
Gloria, who, as on the previous night, was doing duty
at the wheel.  There was a flush on her cheeks that
was a tribute to the keen mountain air, and a sparkle
in her dark eyes that told of welling happiness and a
splendid conscious joy.  Radiant as the morn,
fragrant as the pine-laden air, she seemed the embodiment
of a hundred vitalities crowded into one blithe
being.
</p>

<p>
"We are on our honeymoon," returned Trafford,
"and it would be a cold, dank day that could depress
my soaring spirits.  As it is, the impossible beauty
of our surroundings is so intoxicating my bewildered
brain that I am neglecting my duties as brakesman
in a most alarming manner.  We shall be over a
precipice in a minute, if I don't master my exaltation
of spirits."
</p>

<p>
"Perfect love casteth out fear," laughed Gloria.
</p>

<p>
"Is it perfect?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely&mdash;now, dear," she replied.  "From the
first you captured my fancy; that was why I did not
lie to you in Herr Krantz's wine-shop.  Then, when
I thought you had killed Karl in the Iron Maiden, my
heart grew sick and cold, for I believed you were, as
the others, without ruth or mercy.  The news that
you had saved his life while pretending to take it, put
new fire into my soul; but there was ever a war in my
breast between true tenderness and the lust of power.
I had inherited ambition from a long line of callous
ancestors; my whole life had been a tale of scheming,
deadening opportunism.  And Bernhardt, as we know,
with his great domineering personality, was as death
to sentiment.  And then, last night, well, you took
the bit between your teeth and let yourself go.  You
over-rode my will, you set at nought my interests: you
were master, and I handmaid, and my whole soul went
out to you in admiration of your strength, and love
of the way you used it."
</p>

<p>
Trafford drank in the words as he drank in the
clear, sweet air of the mountain-side, and happiness&mdash;the
heroic happiness that befel poets and warriors
in the days of the world's youth, when men were
demi-gods and gods were demi-mortals&mdash;took him with
golden wings and exalted him, so that the soaring
mountain and the wheeling bird and the forest and the
crag and the river were as his brothers and sisters,
fellow members of the worshipful company of rejoicing
creation.
</p>

<p>
Onward and downward they flew, while the beams
of the rising sun climbed down the valley walls, ledge
by ledge and rock by rock, turning brown cliffs to
gold, and snowy slopes to diamond and silver.  Already
they were far below the supreme height of the Weissheim
plateau, and the air, dry though it was in reality,
seemed almost damp in comparison after the moistureless
atmosphere of the lofty tableland they had quitted.
The snow held everywhere, but it was the thin covering
of an English hill-side in January, not the sumptuous
and universal mantle of frost-bound Weissheim.
The larch and fir of the uplands were giving gradual
place to the stunted oak and the starved chestnut.  A
thin hedge maintained a scrubby, struggling line at
the edge of the roadside, and on the southern slopes
the fields were furrowed in endless terraces for the vine.
</p>

<p>
"We shall reach the frontier in an hour," said Trafford.
</p>

<p>
"And then?"
</p>

<p>
"Then we must quit our faithful 'bob.'  The road
ceases to run downhill at Morgenthal, and a bob-sleigh
will not defy the laws of gravity even for the happiest
couple in Christendom."
</p>

<p>
"Then what are our plans?" asked Gloria.
</p>

<p>
"Plans!" he echoed; "we have no plans.  The poor,
the unhappy, and the hungry have plans, for they
must scheme to improve their condition.  But you and
I are rich in every gift, and life will be one delicious
and unending bob-sleigh ride through gorgeous scenery
and vitalising air."
</p>

<p>
The Princes sighed luxuriously.  Then, after a
pause&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"We must reach the valley some day," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Some day, yes," he acquiesced.  "Some day the
ride will be done, and the road end in the great shadows
which no human eye can pierce.  But that day will
find us hand in hand, with no fear in our hearts, and
ready for a longer, stranger, and even more beautiful
journey."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke the valley widened out, and the hills on
either side receded at a broad angle.  The roofs of
Morgenthal were plain to their gaze, and the tinkling
of goats' bells broke the silence.
</p>

<p>
"Austria!" cried Gloria.
</p>

<p>
"Austria, Vienna, Paris, London," he said, "Southampton,
and then the very first boat bound for little
old New York.  But in our hearts Grimland&mdash;always
Grimland."
</p>
